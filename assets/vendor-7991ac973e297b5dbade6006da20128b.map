It helps to instantiate, initialize and coordinate the many\n    objects that make up your app.\n  \n    Each Ember app has one and only one `Ember.Application` object. In fact, the\n    very first thing you should do in your application is create the instance:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    window.App = Ember.Application.create();\n    ```\n  \n    Typically, the application object is the only global variable. All other\n    classes in your app should be properties on the `Ember.Application` instance,\n    which highlights its first role: a global namespace.\n  \n    For example, if you define a view class, it might look like this:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    App.MyView = Ember.View.extend();\n    ```\n  \n    By default, calling `Ember.Application.create()` will automatically initialize\n    your application by calling the `Ember.Application.initialize()` method. If\n    you need to delay initialization, you can call your app's `deferReadiness()`\n    method. When you are ready for your app to be initialized, call its\n    `advanceReadiness()` method.\n  \n    You can define a `ready` method on the `Ember.Application` instance, which\n    will be run by Ember when the application is initialized.\n  \n    Because `Ember.Application` inherits from `Ember.Namespace`, any classes\n    you create will have useful string representations when calling `toString()`.\n    See the `Ember.Namespace` documentation for more information.\n  \n    While you can think of your `Ember.Application` as a container that holds the\n    other classes in your application, there are several other responsibilities\n    going on under-the-hood that you may want to understand.\n  \n    ### Event Delegation\n  \n    Ember uses a technique called _event delegation_. This allows the framework\n    to set up a global, shared event listener instead of requiring each view to\n    do it manually. For example, instead of each view registering its own\n    `mousedown` listener on its associated element, Ember sets up a `mousedown`\n    listener on the `body`.\n  \n    If a `mousedown` event occurs, Ember will look at the target of the event and\n    start walking up the DOM node tree, finding corresponding views and invoking\n    their `mouseDown` method as it goes.\n  \n    `Ember.Application` has a number of default events that it listens for, as\n    well as a mapping from lowercase events to camel-cased view method names. For\n    example, the `keypress` event causes the `keyPress` method on the view to be\n    called, the `dblclick` event causes `doubleClick` to be called, and so on.\n  \n    If there is a bubbling browser event that Ember does not listen for by\n    default, you can specify custom events and their corresponding view method\n    names by setting the application's `customEvents` property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let App = Ember.Application.create({\n      customEvents: {\n        // add support for the paste event\n        paste: 'paste'\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    To prevent Ember from setting up a listener for a default event,\n    specify the event name with a `null` value in the `customEvents`\n    property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let App = Ember.Application.create({\n      customEvents: {\n        // prevent listeners for mouseenter/mouseleave events\n        mouseenter: null,\n        mouseleave: null\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    By default, the application sets up these event listeners on the document\n    body. However, in cases where you are embedding an Ember application inside\n    an existing page, you may want it to set up the listeners on an element\n    inside the body.\n  \n    For example, if only events inside a DOM element with the ID of `ember-app`\n    should be delegated, set your application's `rootElement` property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let App = Ember.Application.create({\n      rootElement: '#ember-app'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    The `rootElement` can be either a DOM element or a jQuery-compatible selector\n    string. Note that *views appended to the DOM outside the root element will\n    not receive events.* If you specify a custom root element, make sure you only\n    append views inside it!\n  \n    To learn more about the events Ember components use, see\n    [components/handling-events](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.6.0/components/handling-events/#toc_event-names).\n  \n    ### Initializers\n  \n    Libraries on top of Ember can add initializers, like so:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    Ember.Application.initializer({\n      name: 'api-adapter',\n  \n      initialize: function(application) {\n        application.register('api-adapter:main', ApiAdapter);\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Initializers provide an opportunity to access the internal registry, which\n    organizes the different components of an Ember application. Additionally\n    they provide a chance to access the instantiated application. Beyond\n    being used for libraries, initializers are also a great way to organize\n    dependency injection or setup in your own application.\n  \n    ### Routing\n  \n    In addition to creating your application's router, `Ember.Application` is\n    also responsible for telling the router when to start routing. Transitions\n    between routes can be logged with the `LOG_TRANSITIONS` flag, and more\n    detailed intra-transition logging can be logged with\n    the `LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL` flag:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let App = Ember.Application.create({\n      LOG_TRANSITIONS: true, // basic logging of successful transitions\n      LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL: true // detailed logging of all routing steps\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    By default, the router will begin trying to translate the current URL into\n    application state once the browser emits the `DOMContentReady` event. If you\n    need to defer routing, you can call the application's `deferReadiness()`\n    method. Once routing can begin, call the `advanceReadiness()` method.\n  \n    If there is any setup required before routing begins, you can implement a\n    `ready()` method on your app that will be invoked immediately before routing\n    begins.\n  \n    @class Application\n    @namespace Ember\n    @extends Ember.Engine\n    @uses RegistryProxyMixin\n    @public\n  */\n\n  var Application = _emberApplicationSystemEngine.default.extend({\n    /**\n      The root DOM element of the Application.

This could enable extra configuration, or enable asserting prior\n      to the app becoming ready.\n       ```javascript\n      let App;\n       run(function() {\n        App = Ember.Application.create();\n      });\n       module('acceptance test', {\n        setup: function() {\n          run(function() {\n            App.reset();\n            App.deferReadiness();\n          });\n        }\n      });\n       test('first test', function() {\n        ok(true, 'something before app is initialized');\n         run(function() {\n          App.advanceReadiness();\n        });\n         ok(true, 'something after app is initialized');\n      });\n      ```\n       @method reset\n      @public\n    */\n    reset: function () {\n\n      var instance = this.__deprecatedInstance__;\n\n      this._readinessDeferrals = 1;\n      this._bootPromise = null;\n      this._bootResolver = null;\n      this._booted = false;\n\n      function handleReset() {\n        _emberMetal.run(instance, 'destroy');\n        this._buildDeprecatedInstance();\n        _emberMetal.run.schedule('actions', this, '_bootSync');\n      }\n\n      _emberMetal.run.join(this, handleReset);\n    },\n\n    /**\n      @private\n      @method didBecomeReady\n    */\n    didBecomeReady: function () {\n      try {\n        // TODO: Is this still needed for _globalsMode = false?\n        if (!_emberDebug.isTesting()) {\n          // Eagerly name all classes that are already loaded\n          _emberRuntime.Namespace.processAll();\n          _emberRuntime.setNamespaceSearchDisabled(true);\n        }\n\n        // See documentation on `_autoboot()` for details\n        if (this.autoboot) {\n          var instance = undefined;\n\n          if (this._globalsMode) {\n            // If we already have the __deprecatedInstance__ lying around, boot it to\n            // avoid unnecessary work\n            instance = this.__deprecatedInstance__;\n          } else {\n            // Otherwise, build an instance and boot it.

Returns a `Promise` that\n      resolves with the instance when the initial routing and rendering is\n      complete, or rejects with any error that occured during the boot process.\n       When `autoboot` is disabled, calling `visit` would first cause the\n      application to boot, which runs the application initializers.\n       This method also takes a hash of boot-time configuration options for\n      customizing the instance's behavior. See the documentation on\n      `Ember.ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` for details.\n       `Ember.ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` is an interface class that exists\n      purely to document the available options; you do not need to construct it\n      manually. Simply pass a regular JavaScript object containing of the\n      desired options:\n       ```javascript\n      MyApp.visit(\"/\", { location: \"none\", rootElement: \"#container\" });\n      ```\n       ### Supported Scenarios\n       While the `BootOptions` class exposes a large number of knobs, not all\n      combinations of them are valid; certain incompatible combinations might\n      result in unexpected behavior.\n       For example, booting the instance in the full browser environment\n      while specifying a foriegn `document` object (e.g. `{ isBrowser: true,\n      document: iframe.contentDocument }`) does not work correctly today,\n      largely due to Ember's jQuery dependency.\n       Currently, there are three officially supported scenarios/configurations.\n      Usages outside of these scenarios are not guaranteed to work, but please\n      feel free to file bug reports documenting your experience and any issues\n      you encountered to help expand support.\n       #### Browser Applications (Manual Boot)\n       The setup is largely similar to how Ember works out-of-the-box. Normally,\n      Ember will boot a default instance for your Application on \"DOM ready\".\n      However, you can customize this behavior by disabling `autoboot`.\n       For example, this allows you to render a miniture demo of your application\n      into a specific area on your marketing website:\n       ```javascript\n      import MyApp from 'my-app';\n       $(function() {\n        let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });\n         let options = {\n          // Override the router's location adapter to prevent it from updating\n          // the URL in the address bar\n          location: 'none',\n           // Override the default `rootElement` on the app to render into a\n          // specific `div` on the page\n          rootElement: '#demo'\n        };\n         // Start the app at the special demo URL\n        App.visit('/demo', options);\n      });\n      ````\n       Or perhaps you might want to boot two instances of your app on the same\n      page for a split-screen multiplayer experience:\n       ```javascript\n      import MyApp from 'my-app';\n       $(function() {\n        let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });\n         let sessionId = MyApp.generateSessionID();\n         let player1 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+1&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#left', location: 'none' });\n        let player2 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+2&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#right', location: 'none' });\n         Promise.all([player1, player2]).then(() => {\n          // Both apps have completed the initial render\n          $('#loading').fadeOut();\n        });\n      });\n      ```\n       Do note that each app instance maintains their own registry/container, so\n      they will run in complete isolation by default.\n       #### Server-Side Rendering (also known as FastBoot)\n       This setup allows you to run your Ember app in a server environment using\n      Node.js and render its content into static HTML for SEO purposes.\n       ```javascript\n      const HTMLSerializer = new SimpleDOM.HTMLSerializer(SimpleDOM.voidMap);\n       function renderURL(url) {\n        let dom = new SimpleDOM.Document();\n        let rootElement = dom.body;\n        let options = { isBrowser: false, document: dom, rootElement: rootElement };\n         return MyApp.visit(options).then(instance => {\n          try {\n            return HTMLSerializer.serialize(rootElement.firstChild);\n          } finally {\n            instance.destroy();\n          }\n        });\n      }\n      ```\n       In this scenario, because Ember does not have access to a global `document`\n      object in the Node.js environment, you must provide one explicitly. In practice,\n      in the non-browser environment, the stand-in `document` object only need to\n      implement a limited subset of the full DOM API. The `SimpleDOM` library is known\n      to work.\n       Since there is no access to jQuery in the non-browser environment, you must also\n      specify a DOM `Element` object in the same `document` for the `rootElement` option\n      (as opposed to a selector string like `\"body\"`).\n       See the documentation on the `isBrowser`, `document` and `rootElement` properties\n      on `Ember.ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` for details.\n       #### Server-Side Resource Discovery\n       This setup allows you to run the routing layer of your Ember app in a server\n      environment using Node.js and completely disable rendering. This allows you\n      to simulate and discover the resources (i.e. AJAX requests) needed to fufill\n      a given request and eagerly \"push\" these resources to the client.\n       ```app/initializers/network-service.js\n      import BrowserNetworkService from 'app/services/network/browser';\n      import NodeNetworkService from 'app/services/network/node';\n       // Inject a (hypothetical) service for abstracting all AJAX calls and use\n      // the appropiate implementaion on the client/server. This also allows the\n      // server to log all the AJAX calls made during a particular request and use\n      // that for resource-discovery purpose.\n       export function initialize(application) {\n        if (window) { // browser\n          application.register('service:network', BrowserNetworkService);\n        } else { // node\n          application.register('service:network', NodeNetworkService);\n        }\n         application.inject('route', 'network', 'service:network');\n      };\n       export default {\n        name: 'network-service',\n        initialize: initialize\n      };\n      ```\n       ```app/routes/post.js\n      import Ember from 'ember';\n       // An example of how the (hypothetical) service is used in routes.\n       export default Ember.Route.extend({\n        model(params) {\n          return this.network.fetch(`/api/posts/${params.post_id}.json`);\n        },\n         afterModel(post) {\n          if (post.isExternalContent) {\n            return this.network.fetch(`/api/external/?url=${post.externalURL}`);\n          } else {\n            return post;\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```javascript\n      // Finally, put all the pieces together\n       function discoverResourcesFor(url) {\n        return MyApp.visit(url, { isBrowser: false, shouldRender: false }).then(instance => {\n          let networkService = instance.lookup('service:network');\n          return networkService.requests; // => { \"/api/posts/123.json\": \"...\" }\n        });\n      }\n      ```\n       @public\n      @method visit\n      @param url {String} The initial URL to navigate to\n      @param options {Ember.ApplicationInstance.BootOptions}\n      @return {Promise<Ember.ApplicationInstance, Error>}\n    */\n    visit: function (url, options) {\n      var _this = this;\n\n      return this.boot().then(function () {\n        var instance = _this.buildInstance();\n\n        return instance.boot(options).then(function () {\n          return instance.visit(url);\n        }).catch(function (error) {\n          _emberMetal.run(instance, 'destroy');\n          throw error;\n        });\n      });\n    }\n  });\n\n  Object.defineProperty(Application.prototype, 'registry', {\n    configurable: true,\n    enumerable: false,\n    get: function () {\n      return _emberRuntime.buildFakeRegistryWithDeprecations(this, 'Application');\n    }\n  });\n\n  Application.reopenClass({\n    /**\n      This creates a registry with the default Ember naming conventions.\n       It also configures the registry:\n       * registered views are created every time they are looked up (they are\n        not singletons)\n      * registered templates are not factories; the registered value is\n        returned directly.\n      * the router receives the application as its `namespace` property\n      * all controllers receive the router as their `target` and `controllers`\n        properties\n      * all controllers receive the application as their `namespace` property\n      * the application view receives the application controller as its\n        `controller` property\n      * the application view receives the application template as its\n        `defaultTemplate` property\n       @method buildRegistry\n      @static\n      @param {Ember.Application} namespace the application for which to\n        build the registry\n      @return {Ember.Registry} the built registry\n      @private\n    */\n    buildRegistry: function (application) {\n      var options = arguments.length <= 1 || arguments[1] === undefined ?

For example, you could enhance how a template\n    is resolved like so:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    App = Ember.Application.create({\n      Resolver: Ember.DefaultResolver.extend({\n        resolveTemplate: function(parsedName) {\n          let resolvedTemplate = this._super(parsedName);\n          if (resolvedTemplate) { return resolvedTemplate; }\n          return Ember.TEMPLATES['not_found'];\n        }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Some examples of how names are resolved:\n  \n    ```\n    'template:post'           //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['post']\n    'template:posts/byline'   //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['posts/byline']\n    'template:posts.byline'   //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['posts/byline']\n    'template:blogPost'       //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['blogPost']\n                              //   OR\n                              //   Ember.TEMPLATES['blog_post']\n    'controller:post'         //=> App.PostController\n    'controller:posts.index'  //=> App.PostsIndexController\n    'controller:blog/post'    //=> Blog.PostController\n    'controller:basic'        //=> Ember.Controller\n    'route:post'              //=> App.PostRoute\n    'route:posts.index'       //=> App.PostsIndexRoute\n    'route:blog/post'         //=> Blog.PostRoute\n    'route:basic'             //=> Ember.Route\n    'view:post'               //=> App.PostView\n    'view:posts.index'        //=> App.PostsIndexView\n    'view:blog/post'          //=> Blog.PostView\n    'view:basic'              //=> Ember.View\n    'foo:post'                //=> App.PostFoo\n    'model:post'              //=> App.Post\n    ```\n  \n    @class DefaultResolver\n    @namespace Ember\n    @extends Ember.Object\n    @public\n  */\n\n  exports.default = _emberRuntime.Object.extend({\n    /**\n      This will be set to the Application instance when it is\n      created.\n       @property namespace\n      @public\n    */\n    namespace: null,\n\n    init: function () {\n      this._parseNameCache = _emberUtils.dictionary(null);\n    },\n    normalize: function (fullName) {\n      var _fullName$split = fullName.split(':', 2);\n\n      var type = _fullName$split[0];\n      var name = _fullName$split[1];\n\n      if (type !== 'template') {\n        var result = name;\n\n        if (result.indexOf('.') > -1) {\n          result = result.replace(/\\.(.)/g, function (m) {\n            return m.charAt(1).toUpperCase();\n          });\n        }\n\n        if (name.indexOf('_') > -1) {\n          result = result.replace(/_(.)/g, function (m) {\n            return m.charAt(1).toUpperCase();\n          });\n        }\n\n        if (name.indexOf('-') > -1) {\n          result = result.replace(/-(.)/g, function (m) {\n            return m.charAt(1).toUpperCase();\n          });\n        }\n\n        return type + ':' + result;\n      } else {\n        return fullName;\n      }\n    },\n\n    /**\n      This method is called via the container's resolver method.\n      It parses the provided `fullName` and then looks up and\n      returns the appropriate template or class.\n       @method resolve\n      @param {String} fullName the lookup string\n      @return {Object} the resolved factory\n      @public\n    */\n    resolve: function (fullName) {\n      var parsedName = this.parseName(fullName);\n      var resolveMethodName = parsedName.resolveMethodName;\n      var resolved = undefined;\n\n      if (this[resolveMethodName]) {\n        resolved = this[resolveMethodName](parsedName);\n      }\n\n      resolved = resolved || this.resolveOther(parsedName);\n\n      if (resolved) {\n        _emberApplicationUtilsValidateType.default(resolved, parsedName);\n      }\n\n      return resolved;\n    },\n\n    /**\n      Convert the string name of the form 'type:name' to\n      a Javascript object with the parsed aspects of the name\n      broken out.\n       @param {String} fullName the lookup string\n      @method parseName\n      @protected\n    */\n\n    parseName: function (fullName) {\n      return this._parseNameCache[fullName] || (this._parseNameCache[fullName] = this._parseName(fullName));\n    },\n\n    _parseName: function (fullName) {\n      var _fullName$split2 = fullName.split(':');\n\n      var type = _fullName$split2[0];\n      var fullNameWithoutType = _fullName$split2[1];\n\n      var name = fullNameWithoutType;\n      var namespace = _emberMetal.get(this, 'namespace');\n      var root = namespace;\n      var lastSlashIndex = name.lastIndexOf('/');\n      var dirname = lastSlashIndex !== -1 ? name.slice(0, lastSlashIndex) : null;\n\n      if (type !== 'template' && lastSlashIndex !== -1) {\n        var parts = name.split('/');\n        name = parts[parts.length - 1];\n        var namespaceName = _emberRuntime.String.capitalize(parts.slice(0, -1).join('.'));\n        root = _emberRuntime.Namespace.byName(namespaceName);\n      }\n\n      var resolveMethodName = fullNameWithoutType === 'main' ?

Properties accessed in its templates go\n    to the view object and actions are targeted at\n    the view object. There is no access to the\n    surrounding context or outer controller; all\n    contextual information must be passed in.\n  \n    The easiest way to create an `Ember.Component` is via\n    a template. If you name a template\n    `app/components/my-foo.hbs`, you will be able to use\n    `{{my-foo}}` in other templates, which will make\n    an instance of the isolated component.\n  \n    ```app/components/my-foo.hbs\n    {{person-profile person=currentUser}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/components/person-profile.hbs\n    <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n    <img src={{person.avatar}}>\n    <p class='signature'>{{person.signature}}</p>\n    ```\n  \n    You can use `yield` inside a template to\n    include the **contents** of any block attached to\n    the component. The block will be executed in the\n    context of the surrounding context or outer controller:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#person-profile person=currentUser}}\n      <p>Admin mode</p>\n      {{! Executed in the controller's context. }}\n    {{/person-profile}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/components/person-profile.hbs\n    <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n    {{! Executed in the component's context. }}\n    {{yield}} {{! block contents }}\n    ```\n  \n    If you want to customize the component, in order to\n    handle events or actions, you implement a subclass\n    of `Ember.Component` named after the name of the\n    component.\n  \n    For example, you could implement the action\n    `hello` for the `person-profile` component:\n  \n    ```app/components/person-profile.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      actions: {\n        hello(name) {\n          console.log(\"Hello\", name);\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    And then use it in the component's template:\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n    <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n    {{yield}} <!-- block contents -->\n    <button {{action 'hello' person.name}}>\n      Say Hello to {{person.name}}\n    </button>\n    ```\n  \n    Components must have a `-` in their name to avoid\n    conflicts with built-in controls that wrap HTML\n    elements. This is consistent with the same\n    requirement in web components.\n  \n  \n    ## HTML Tag\n  \n    The default HTML tag name used for a component's DOM representation is `div`.\n    This can be customized by setting the `tagName` property.\n    The following component class:\n  \n    ```app/components/emphasized-paragraph.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'em'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Would result in instances with the following HTML:\n  \n    ```html\n    <em id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></em>\n    ```\n  \n  \n    ## HTML `class` Attribute\n  \n    The HTML `class` attribute of a component's tag can be set by providing a\n    `classNames` property that is set to an array of strings:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      classNames: ['my-class', 'my-other-class']\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view my-class my-other-class\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    `class` attribute values can also be set by providing a `classNameBindings`\n    property set to an array of properties names for the component. The return value\n    of these properties will be added as part of the value for the components's `class`\n    attribute. These properties can be computed properties:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['propertyA', 'propertyB'],\n      propertyA: 'from-a',\n      propertyB: Ember.computed(function() {\n        if (someLogic) { return 'from-b'; }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view from-a from-b\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    If the value of a class name binding returns a boolean the property name\n    itself will be used as the class name if the property is true.\n    The class name will not be added if the value is `false` or `undefined`.\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['hovered'],\n      hovered: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view hovered\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    When using boolean class name bindings you can supply a string value other\n    than the property name for use as the `class` HTML attribute by appending the\n    preferred value after a \":\" character when defining the binding:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['awesome:so-very-cool'],\n      awesome: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view so-very-cool\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    Boolean value class name bindings whose property names are in a\n    camelCase-style format will be converted to a dasherized format:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['isUrgent'],\n      isUrgent: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view is-urgent\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    Class name bindings can also refer to object values that are found by\n    traversing a path relative to the component itself:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['messages.empty'],\n      messages: Ember.Object.create({\n        empty: true\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view empty\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    If you want to add a class name for a property which evaluates to true and\n    and a different class name if it evaluates to false, you can pass a binding\n    like this:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['isEnabled:enabled:disabled'],\n      isEnabled: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view enabled\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    When isEnabled is `false`, the resulting HTML representation looks like\n    this:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    This syntax offers the convenience to add a class if a property is `false`:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    // Applies no class when isEnabled is true and class 'disabled' when isEnabled is false\n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['isEnabled::disabled'],\n      isEnabled: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    When the `isEnabled` property on the component is set to `false`, it will result\n    in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    Updates to the value of a class name binding will result in automatic\n    update of the  HTML `class` attribute in the component's rendered HTML\n    representation. If the value becomes `false` or `undefined` the class name\n    will be removed.\n    Both `classNames` and `classNameBindings` are concatenated properties. See\n    [Ember.Object](/api/classes/Ember.Object.html) documentation for more\n    information about concatenated properties.\n  \n  \n    ## HTML Attributes\n  \n    The HTML attribute section of a component's tag can be set by providing an\n    `attributeBindings` property set to an array of property names on the component.\n    The return value of these properties will be used as the value of the component's\n    HTML associated attribute:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-anchor.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'a',\n      attributeBindings: ['href'],\n      href: 'http://google.com'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://google.com\"></a>\n    ```\n  \n    One property can be mapped on to another by placing a \":\" between\n    the source property and the destination property:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-anchor.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'a',\n      attributeBindings: ['url:href'],\n      url: 'http://google.com'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://google.com\"></a>\n    ```\n  \n    Namespaced attributes (e.g. `xlink:href`) are supported, but have to be\n    mapped, since `:` is not a valid character for properties in Javascript:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-use.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'use',\n      attributeBindings: ['xlinkHref:xlink:href'],\n      xlinkHref: '#triangle'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <use xlink:href=\"#triangle\"></use>\n    ```\n  \n    If the return value of an `attributeBindings` monitored property is a boolean\n    the attribute will be present or absent depending on the value:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'input',\n      attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n      disabled: false\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in a component instance with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <input id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" />\n    ```\n  \n    `attributeBindings` can refer to computed properties:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'input',\n      attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n      disabled: Ember.computed(function() {\n        if (someLogic) {\n          return true;\n        } else {\n          return false;\n        }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    To prevent setting an attribute altogether, use `null` or `undefined` as the\n    return value of the `attributeBindings` monitored property:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'form',\n      attributeBindings: ['novalidate'],\n      novalidate: null\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Updates to the property of an attribute binding will result in automatic\n    update of the  HTML attribute in the component's rendered HTML representation.\n    `attributeBindings` is a concatenated property. See [Ember.Object](/api/classes/Ember.Object.html)\n    documentation for more information about concatenated properties.\n  \n  \n    ## Layouts\n  \n    See [Ember.Templates.helpers.yield](/api/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers.html#method_yield)\n    for more information.\n  \n  \n    ## Responding to Browser Events\n  \n    Components can respond to user-initiated events in one of three ways: method\n    implementation, through an event manager, and through `{{action}}` helper use\n    in their template or layout.\n  \n  \n    ### Method Implementation\n  \n    Components can respond to user-initiated events by implementing a method that\n    matches the event name. A `jQuery.Event` object will be passed as the\n    argument to this method.\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      click(event) {\n        // will be called when an instance's\n        // rendered element is clicked\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n  \n    ### `{{action}}` Helper\n  \n    See [Ember.Templates.helpers.action](/api/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers.html#method_action).\n  \n  \n    ### Event Names\n  \n    All of the event handling approaches described above respond to the same set\n    of events. The names of the built-in events are listed below. (The hash of\n    built-in events exists in `Ember.EventDispatcher`.)

If an attribute has not\n  changed, it is important not to clobber the element's \"hidden state\".\n  For example, if you set an input's `value` to the same value as before,\n  it will clobber selection state and cursor position. In other words,\n  setting an attribute is not **always** idempotent.\n   This method provides a way to read an element's attribute and also\n  update the last value Ember knows about at the same time. This makes\n  setting an attribute idempotent.\n   In particular, what this means is that if you get an `<input>` element's\n  `value` attribute and then re-render the template with the same value,\n  it will avoid clobbering the cursor and selection position.\n  Since most attribute sets are idempotent in the browser, you typically\n  can get away with reading attributes using jQuery, but the most reliable\n  way to do so is through this method.\n  @method readDOMAttr\n   @param {String} name the name of the attribute\n  @return String\n  @public\n */\nenifed('ember-glimmer/components/checkbox', ['exports', 'ember-metal', 'ember-glimmer/component', 'ember-glimmer/templates/empty'], function (exports, _emberMetal, _emberGlimmerComponent, _emberGlimmerTemplatesEmpty) {\n  'use strict';\n\n  /**\n  @module ember\n  @submodule ember-views\n  */\n\n  /**\n    The internal class used to create text inputs when the `{{input}}`\n    helper is used with `type` of `checkbox`.\n  \n    See [Ember.Templates.helpers.input](/api/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers.html#method_input)  for usage details.\n  \n    ## Direct manipulation of `checked`\n  \n    The `checked` attribute of an `Ember.Checkbox` object should always be set\n    through the Ember object or by interacting with its rendered element\n    representation via the mouse, keyboard, or touch.

For example, if the application's\n    current route is 'photoGallery.recent' the following\n    use of `{{link-to}}`:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to 'photoGallery.recent'}}\n      Great Hamster Photos\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n  \n    will result in\n  \n    ```html\n    <a href=\"/hamster-photos/this-week\" class=\"active\">\n      Great Hamster Photos\n    </a>\n    ```\n  \n    The CSS class name used for active classes can be customized\n    for a single use of `{{link-to}}` by passing an `activeClass`\n    option:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to 'photoGallery.recent' activeClass=\"current-url\"}}\n      Great Hamster Photos\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```html\n    <a href=\"/hamster-photos/this-week\" class=\"current-url\">\n      Great Hamster Photos\n    </a>\n    ```\n  \n    To override this option for your entire application, see\n    \"Overriding Application-wide Defaults\".\n  \n    ### Keeping a link active for other routes\n  \n    If you need a link to be 'active' even when it doesn't match\n    the current route, you can use the `current-when` argument.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to 'photoGallery' current-when='photos'}}\n      Photo Gallery\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n  \n    This may be helpful for keeping links active for:\n  \n    * non-nested routes that are logically related\n    * some secondary menu approaches\n    * 'top navigation' with 'sub navigation' scenarios\n  \n    A link will be active if `current-when` is `true` or the current\n    route is the route this link would transition to.\n  \n    To match multiple routes 'space-separate' the routes:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to 'gallery' current-when='photos drawings paintings'}}\n      Art Gallery\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n  \n    ### Supplying a model\n    An optional model argument can be used for routes whose\n    paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become\n    the model context of the linked route:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    Router.map(function() {\n      this.route(\"photoGallery\", {path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\"});\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to 'photoGallery' aPhoto}}\n      {{aPhoto.title}}\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```html\n    <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42\">\n      Tomster\n    </a>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Supplying multiple models\n    For deep-linking to route paths that contain multiple\n    dynamic segments, multiple model arguments can be used.\n    As the router transitions through the route path, each\n    supplied model argument will become the context for the\n    route with the dynamic segments:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    Router.map(function() {\n      this.route(\"photoGallery\", { path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\" }, function() {\n        this.route(\"comment\", {path: \"comments/:comment_id\"});\n      });\n    });\n    ```\n    This argument will become the model context of the linked route:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to 'photoGallery.comment' aPhoto comment}}\n      {{comment.body}}\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```html\n    <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42/comments/718\">\n      A+++ would snuggle again.\n    </a>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Supplying an explicit dynamic segment value\n    If you don't have a model object available to pass to `{{link-to}}`,\n    an optional string or integer argument can be passed for routes whose\n    paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become the value\n    of the dynamic segment:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    Router.map(function() {\n      this.route(\"photoGallery\", { path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\" });\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to 'photoGallery' aPhotoId}}\n      {{aPhoto.title}}\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```html\n    <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42\">\n      Tomster\n    </a>\n    ```\n  \n    When transitioning into the linked route, the `model` hook will\n    be triggered with parameters including this passed identifier.\n  \n    ### Allowing Default Action\n  \n   By default the `{{link-to}}` component prevents the default browser action\n   by calling `preventDefault()` as this sort of action bubbling is normally\n   handled internally and we do not want to take the browser to a new URL (for\n   example).\n  \n   If you need to override this behavior specify `preventDefault=false` in\n   your template:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to 'photoGallery' aPhotoId preventDefault=false}}\n      {{aPhotoId.title}}\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n  \n    ### Overriding attributes\n    You can override any given property of the `Ember.LinkComponent`\n    that is generated by the `{{link-to}}` component by passing\n    key/value pairs, like so:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to  aPhoto tagName='li' title='Following this link will change your life' classNames='pic sweet'}}\n      Uh-mazing!\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n  \n    See [Ember.LinkComponent](/api/classes/Ember.LinkComponent.html) for a\n    complete list of overrideable properties.

To override options for your entire\n    application, reopen `Ember.LinkComponent` and supply the\n    desired values:\n  \n    ``` javascript\n    Ember.LinkComponent.reopen({\n      activeClass: \"is-active\",\n      tagName: 'li'\n    })\n    ```\n  \n    It is also possible to override the default event in\n    this manner:\n  \n    ``` javascript\n    Ember.LinkComponent.reopen({\n      eventName: 'customEventName'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method link-to\n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @param {String} routeName\n    @param {Object} [context]*\n    @param [options] {Object} Handlebars key/value pairs of options, you can override any property of Ember.LinkComponent\n    @return {String} HTML string\n    @see {Ember.LinkComponent}\n    @public\n  */\n\n  'use strict';\n\n  /**\n    `Ember.LinkComponent` renders an element whose `click` event triggers a\n    transition of the application's instance of `Ember.Router` to\n    a supplied route by name.\n  \n    `Ember.LinkComponent` components are invoked with {{#link-to}}.

Type into\n    either text area box and they'll both stay in sync. Note that\n    `Ember.computed.alias` costs more in terms of performance, so only use it when\n    your really binding in both directions:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({\n      writtenWords: \"Lots of text that IS bound\",\n      twoWayWrittenWords: Ember.computed.alias(\"writtenWords\")\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{textarea value=writtenWords}}\n    {{textarea value=twoWayWrittenWords}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```html\n    <textarea id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-text-area\">\n      Lots of text that IS bound\n    </textarea>\n    <-- both updated in real time -->\n    <textarea id=\"ember2\" class=\"ember-text-area\">\n      Lots of text that IS bound\n    </textarea>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Actions\n  \n    The helper can send multiple actions based on user events.\n    The action property defines the action which is send when\n    the user presses the return key.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{input action=\"submit\"}}\n    ```\n  \n    The helper allows some user events to send actions.\n  \n    * `enter`\n    * `insert-newline`\n    * `escape-press`\n    * `focus-in`\n    * `focus-out`\n    * `key-press`\n  \n    For example, if you desire an action to be sent when the input is blurred,\n    you only need to setup the action name to the event name property.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{textarea focus-out=\"alertMessage\"}}\n    ```\n  \n    See more about [Text Support Actions](/api/classes/Ember.TextArea.html)\n  \n    ### Extension\n  \n    Internally, `{{textarea}}` creates an instance of `Ember.TextArea`, passing\n    arguments from the helper to `Ember.TextArea`'s `create` method. You can\n    extend the capabilities of text areas in your application by reopening this\n    class. For example, if you are building a Bootstrap project where `data-*`\n    attributes are used, you can globally add support for a `data-*` attribute\n    on all `{{textarea}}`s' in your app by reopening `Ember.TextArea` or\n    `Ember.TextSupport` and adding it to the `attributeBindings` concatenated\n    property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    Ember.TextArea.reopen({\n      attributeBindings: ['data-error']\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Keep in mind when writing `Ember.TextArea` subclasses that `Ember.TextArea`\n    itself extends `Ember.Component`. Expect isolated component semantics, not\n    legacy 1.x view semantics (like `controller` being present).\n  \n    See more about [Ember components](/api/classes/Ember.Component.html)\n  \n    @method textarea\n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @param {Hash} options\n    @public\n  */\n\n  /**\n    The internal class used to create textarea element when the `{{textarea}}`\n    helper is used.\n  \n    See [Ember.Templates.helpers.textarea](/api/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers.html#method_textarea)  for usage details.\n  \n    ## Layout and LayoutName properties\n  \n    Because HTML `textarea` elements do not contain inner HTML the `layout` and\n    `layoutName` properties will not be applied.

The first two\n    contexts to discuss are attribute context, and Handlebars value context.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{! An example of attribute context }}\n    <div onclick={{action \"save\"}}></div>\n    {{! Examples of Handlebars value context }}\n    {{input on-input=(action \"save\")}}\n    {{yield (action \"refreshData\") andAnotherParam}}\n    ```\n  \n    In these contexts,\n    the helper is called a \"closure action\" helper. Its behavior is simple:\n    If passed a function name, read that function off the `actions` property\n    of the current context. Once that function is read (or if a function was\n    passed), create a closure over that function and any arguments.\n    The resulting value of an action helper used this way is simply a function.\n  \n    For example, in the attribute context:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{! An example of attribute context }}\n    <div onclick={{action \"save\"}}></div>\n    ```\n  \n    The resulting template render logic would be:\n  \n    ```js\n    var div = document.createElement('div');\n    var actionFunction = (function(context){\n      return function() {\n        return context.actions.save.apply(context, arguments);\n      };\n    })(context);\n    div.onclick = actionFunction;\n    ```\n  \n    Thus when the div is clicked, the action on that context is called.\n    Because the `actionFunction` is just a function, closure actions can be\n    passed between components and still execute in the correct context.\n  \n    Here is an example action handler on a component:\n  \n    ```js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      actions: {\n        save() {\n          this.get('model').save();\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Actions are always looked up on the `actions` property of the current context.\n    This avoids collisions in the naming of common actions, such as `destroy`.\n    Two options can be passed to the `action` helper when it is used in this way.\n  \n    * `target=someProperty` will look to `someProperty` instead of the current\n      context for the `actions` hash. This can be useful when targetting a\n      service for actions.\n    * `value=\"target.value\"` will read the path `target.value` off the first\n      argument to the action when it is called and rewrite the first argument\n      to be that value. This is useful when attaching actions to event listeners.\n  \n    ### Invoking an action\n  \n    Closure actions curry both their scope and any arguments. When invoked, any\n    additional arguments are added to the already curried list.\n    Actions should be invoked using the [sendAction](/api/classes/Ember.Component.html#method_sendAction)\n    method. The first argument to `sendAction` is the action to be called, and\n    additional arguments are passed to the action function. This has interesting\n    properties combined with currying of arguments. For example:\n  \n    ```js\n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      actions: {\n        // Usage {{input on-input=(action (action 'setName' model) value=\"target.value\")}}\n        setName(model, name) {\n          model.set('name', name);\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    The first argument (`model`) was curried over, and the run-time argument (`event`)\n    becomes a second argument. Action calls can be nested this way because each simply\n    returns a function. Any function can be passed to the `{{action}}` helper, including\n    other actions.\n  \n    Actions invoked with `sendAction` have the same currying behavior as demonstrated\n    with `on-input` above. For example:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-input.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      actions: {\n        setName(model, name) {\n          model.set('name', name);\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{my-input submit=(action 'setName' model)}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/components/my-component.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      click() {\n        // Note that model is not passed, it was curried in the template\n        this.sendAction('submit', 'bob');\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ### Attaching actions to DOM elements\n  \n    The third context of the `{{action}}` helper can be called \"element space\".\n    For example:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{! An example of element space }}\n    <div {{action \"save\"}}></div>\n    ```\n  \n    Used this way, the `{{action}}` helper provides a useful shortcut for\n    registering an HTML element in a template for a single DOM event and\n    forwarding that interaction to the template's context (controller or component).\n    If the context of a template is a controller, actions used this way will\n    bubble to routes when the controller does not implement the specified action.\n    Once an action hits a route, it will bubble through the route hierarchy.\n  \n    ### Event Propagation\n  \n    `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can control event bubbling. Note\n    that the closure style actions cannot.\n  \n    Events triggered through the action helper will automatically have\n    `.preventDefault()` called on them. You do not need to do so in your event\n    handlers. If you need to allow event propagation (to handle file inputs for\n    example) you can supply the `preventDefault=false` option to the `{{action}}` helper:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"sayHello\" preventDefault=false}}>\n      <input type=\"file\" />\n      <input type=\"checkbox\" />\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    To disable bubbling, pass `bubbles=false` to the helper:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <button {{action 'edit' post bubbles=false}}>Edit</button>\n    ```\n  \n    To disable bubbling with closure style actions you must create your own\n    wrapper helper that makes use of `event.stopPropagation()`:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div onclick={{disable-bubbling (action \"sayHello\")}}>Hello</div>\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/helpers/disable-bubbling.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export function disableBubbling([action]) {\n      return function(event) {\n        event.stopPropagation();\n        return action(event);\n      };\n    }\n    export default Ember.Helper.helper(disableBubbling);\n    ```\n  \n    If you need the default handler to trigger you should either register your\n    own event handler, or use event methods on your view class. See\n    [\"Responding to Browser Events\"](/api/classes/Ember.View.html#toc_responding-to-browser-events)\n    in the documentation for Ember.View for more information.\n  \n    ### Specifying DOM event type\n  \n    `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can specify an event type.\n    By default the `{{action}}` helper registers for DOM `click` events. You can\n    supply an `on` option to the helper to specify a different DOM event name:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" on=\"doubleClick\"}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    See [\"Event Names\"](/api/classes/Ember.View.html#toc_event-names) for a list of\n    acceptable DOM event names.\n  \n    ### Specifying whitelisted modifier keys\n  \n    `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can specify modifier keys.\n    By default the `{{action}}` helper will ignore click events with pressed modifier\n    keys. You can supply an `allowedKeys` option to specify which keys should not be ignored.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" allowedKeys=\"alt\"}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    This way the action will fire when clicking with the alt key pressed down.\n    Alternatively, supply \"any\" to the `allowedKeys` option to accept any combination of modifier keys.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" allowedKeys=\"any\"}}>\n      click me with any key pressed\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Specifying a Target\n  \n    A `target` option can be provided to the helper to change\n    which object will receive the method call. This option must be a path\n    to an object, accessible in the current context:\n  \n    ```app/templates/application.hbs\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" target=someService}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/controllers/application.js\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.Controller.extend({\n      someService: Ember.inject.service()\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method action\n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @public\n  */\n\n  exports.default = function (vm, args) {\n    var named = args.named;\n    var positional = args.positional;\n\n    // The first two argument slots are reserved.\n    // pos[0] is the context (or `this`)\n    // pos[1] is the action name or function\n    // Anything else is an action argument.\n    var context = positional.at(0);\n    var action = positional.at(1);\n\n    // TODO: Is there a better way of doing this?\n    var debugKey = action._propertyKey;\n\n    var restArgs = undefined;\n\n    if (positional.length === 2) {\n      restArgs = _glimmerRuntime.EvaluatedPositionalArgs.empty();\n    } else {\n      restArgs = _glimmerRuntime.EvaluatedPositionalArgs.create(positional.values.slice(2));\n    }\n\n    var target = named.has('target') ? named.get('target') : context;\n    var processArgs = makeArgsProcessor(named.has('value') && named.get('value'), restArgs);\n\n    var fn = undefined;\n\n    if (typeof action[INVOKE] === 'function') {\n      fn = makeClosureAction(action, action, action[INVOKE], processArgs, debugKey);\n    } else if (_glimmerReference.isConst(target) && _glimmerReference.isConst(action)) {\n      fn = makeClosureAction(context.value(), target.value(), action.value(), processArgs, debugKey);\n    } else {\n      fn = makeDynamicClosureAction(context.value(), target, action, processArgs, debugKey);\n    }\n\n    fn[ACTION] = true;\n\n    return new _emberGlimmerUtilsReferences.UnboundReference(fn);\n  };\n\n  function NOOP(args) {\n    return args;\n  }\n\n  function makeArgsProcessor(valuePathRef, actionArgsRef) {\n    var mergeArgs = null;\n\n    if (actionArgsRef.length > 0) {\n      mergeArgs = function (args) {\n        return actionArgsRef.value().concat(args);\n      };\n    }\n\n    var readValue = null;\n\n    if (valuePathRef) {\n      readValue = function (args) {\n        var valuePath = valuePathRef.value();\n\n        if (valuePath && args.length > 0) {\n          args[0] = _emberMetal.get(args[0], valuePath);\n        }\n\n        return args;\n      };\n    }\n\n    if (mergeArgs && readValue) {\n      return function (args) {\n        return readValue(mergeArgs(args));\n      };\n    } else {\n      return mergeArgs || readValue || NOOP;\n    }\n  }\n\n  function makeDynamicClosureAction(context, targetRef, actionRef, processArgs, debugKey) {\n\n    return function () {\n      return makeClosureAction(context, targetRef.value(), actionRef.value(), processArgs, debugKey).apply(undefined, arguments);\n    };\n\n    // We don't allow undefined/null values, so this creates a throw-away action to trigger the assertions\n  }\n\n  function makeClosureAction(context, target, action, processArgs, debugKey) {\n    var self = undefined,\n        fn = undefined;\n\n    if (typeof action[INVOKE] === 'function') {\n      self = action;\n      fn = action[INVOKE];\n    } else {\n      var typeofAction = typeof action;\n\n      if (typeofAction === 'string') {\n        self = target;\n        fn = target.actions && target.actions[action];\n      } else if (typeofAction === 'function') {\n        self = context;\n        fn = action;\n      } else {}\n    }\n\n    return function () {\n      for (var _len = arguments.length, args = Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n        args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n      }\n\n      var payload = { target: self, args: args, label: '@glimmer/closure-action' };\n      return _emberMetal.flaggedInstrument('interaction.ember-action', payload, function () {\n        return _emberMetal.run.join.apply(_emberMetal.run, [self, fn].concat(processArgs(args)));\n      });\n    };\n  }\n});\nenifed('ember-glimmer/helpers/component', ['exports', 'ember-utils', 'ember-glimmer/utils/references', 'ember-glimmer/syntax/curly-component', '@glimmer/runtime', 'ember-debug'], function (exports, _emberUtils, _emberGlimmerUtilsReferences, _emberGlimmerSyntaxCurlyComponent, _glimmerRuntime, _emberDebug) {\n  /**\n    @module ember\n    @submodule ember-glimmer\n  */\n  'use strict';\n\n  /**\n    The `{{component}}` helper lets you add instances of `Ember.Component` to a\n    template.

This helper has three modes: inline, block, and nested.\n  \n    ### Inline Form\n  \n    Given the following template:\n  \n    ```app/application.hbs\n    {{component infographicComponentName}}\n    ```\n  \n    And the following application code:\n  \n    ```app/controllers/application.js\n    export default Ember.Controller.extend({\n      infographicComponentName: computed('isMarketOpen', {\n        get() {\n          if (this.get('isMarketOpen')) {\n            return 'live-updating-chart';\n          } else {\n            return 'market-close-summary';\n          }\n        }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    The `live-updating-chart` component will be appended when `isMarketOpen` is\n    `true`, and the `market-close-summary` component will be appended when\n    `isMarketOpen` is `false`. If the value changes while the app is running,\n    the component will be automatically swapped out accordingly.\n    Note: You should not use this helper when you are consistently rendering the same\n    component. In that case, use standard component syntax, for example:\n  \n    ```app/templates/application.hbs\n    {{live-updating-chart}}\n    ```\n  \n    ### Block Form\n  \n    Using the block form of this helper is similar to using the block form\n    of a component. Given the following application template:\n  \n    ```app/templates/application.hbs\n    {{#component infographicComponentName}}\n      Last update: {{lastUpdateTimestamp}}\n    {{/component}}\n    ```\n  \n    The following controller code:\n  \n    ```app/controllers/application.js\n    export default Ember.Controller.extend({\n      lastUpdateTimestamp: computed(function() {\n        return new Date();\n      }),\n  \n      infographicComponentName: computed('isMarketOpen', {\n        get() {\n          if (this.get('isMarketOpen')) {\n            return 'live-updating-chart';\n          } else {\n            return 'market-close-summary';\n          }\n        }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    And the following component template:\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/live-updating-chart.hbs\n    {{! chart }}\n    {{yield}}\n    ```\n  \n    The `Last Update: {{lastUpdateTimestamp}}` will be rendered in place of the `{{yield}}`.\n  \n    ### Nested Usage\n  \n    The `component` helper can be used to package a component path with initial attrs.\n    The included attrs can then be merged during the final invocation.\n    For example, given a `person-form` component with the following template:\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/person-form.hbs\n    {{yield (hash\n      nameInput=(component \"my-input-component\" value=model.name placeholder=\"First Name\")\n    )}}\n    ```\n  \n    When yielding the component via the `hash` helper, the component is invoked directly.\n    See the following snippet:\n  \n    ```\n    {{#person-form as |form|}}\n      {{form.nameInput placeholder=\"Username\"}}\n    {{/person-form}}\n    ```\n  \n    Which outputs an input whose value is already bound to `model.name` and `placeholder`\n    is \"Username\".\n  \n    When yielding the component without the hash helper use the `component` helper.\n    For example, below is a `full-name` component template:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{yield (component \"my-input-component\" value=model.name placeholder=\"Name\")}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```\n    {{#full-name as |field|}}\n      {{component field placeholder=\"Full name\"}}\n    {{/full-name}}\n    ```\n  \n    @method component\n    @since 1.11.0\n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @public\n  */\n\n  var ClosureComponentReference = (function (_CachedReference) {\n    babelHelpers.inherits(ClosureComponentReference, _CachedReference);\n\n    ClosureComponentReference.create = function create(args, symbolTable, env) {\n      return new ClosureComponentReference(args, symbolTable, env);\n    };\n\n    function ClosureComponentReference(args, symbolTable, env) {\n      _CachedReference.call(this);\n\n      var firstArg = args.positional.at(0);\n      this.defRef = firstArg;\n      this.tag = firstArg.tag;\n      this.env = env;\n      this.symbolTable = symbolTable;\n      this.args = args;\n      this.lastDefinition = undefined;\n      this.lastName = undefined;\n    }\n\n    ClosureComponentReference.prototype.compute = function compute() {\n      // TODO: Figure out how to extract this because it's nearly identical to\n      // DynamicComponentReference::compute().

It is an extension\n    of the base Handlebars `{{#each}}` helper.\n    The default behavior of `{{#each}}` is to yield its inner block once for every\n    item in an array passing the item as the first block parameter.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    var developers = [{ name: 'Yehuda' },{ name: 'Tom' }, { name: 'Paul' }];\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#each developers key=\"name\" as |person|}}\n      {{person.name}}\n      {{! `this` is whatever it was outside the #each }}\n    {{/each}}\n    ```\n  \n    The same rules apply to arrays of primitives.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    var developerNames = ['Yehuda', 'Tom', 'Paul']\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#each developerNames key=\"@index\" as |name|}}\n      {{name}}\n    {{/each}}\n    ```\n  \n    During iteration, the index of each item in the array is provided as a second block parameter.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <ul>\n      {{#each people as |person index|}}\n        <li>Hello, {{person.name}}! You're number {{index}} in line</li>\n      {{/each}}\n    </ul>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Specifying Keys\n  \n    The `key` option is used to tell Ember how to determine if the array being\n    iterated over with `{{#each}}` has changed between renders. By helping Ember\n    detect that some elements in the array are the same, DOM elements can be\n    re-used, significantly improving rendering speed.\n  \n    For example, here's the `{{#each}}` helper with its `key` set to `id`:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#each model key=\"id\" as |item|}}\n    {{/each}}\n    ```\n  \n    When this `{{#each}}` re-renders, Ember will match up the previously rendered\n    items (and reorder the generated DOM elements) based on each item's `id`\n    property.\n    By default the item's own reference is used.\n  \n    ### {{else}} condition\n  \n    `{{#each}}` can have a matching `{{else}}`. The contents of this block will render\n    if the collection is empty.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#each developers as |person|}}\n      {{person.name}}\n    {{else}}\n      <p>Sorry, nobody is available for this task.</p>\n    {{/each}}\n    ```\n  \n    @method each\n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @public\n   */\n\n  /**\n    The `{{each-in}}` helper loops over properties on an object.\n  \n    For example, given a `user` object that looks like:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Shelly Sails\",\n      \"age\": 42\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    This template would display all properties on the `user`\n    object in a list:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <ul>\n    {{#each-in user as |key value|}}\n      <li>{{key}}: {{value}}</li>\n    {{/each-in}}\n    </ul>\n    ```\n  \n    Outputting their name and age.\n  \n    @method each-in\n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @public\n    @since 2.1.0\n  */\n  var EACH_IN_REFERENCE = _emberUtils.symbol('EACH_IN');\n\n  function isEachIn(ref) {\n    return ref && ref[EACH_IN_REFERENCE];\n  }\n\n  exports.default = function (vm, args) {\n    var ref = Object.create(args.positional.at(0));\n    ref[EACH_IN_REFERENCE] = true;\n    return ref;\n  };\n});\nenifed('ember-glimmer/helpers/get', ['exports', 'ember-metal', 'ember-glimmer/utils/references', '@glimmer/reference'], function (exports, _emberMetal, _emberGlimmerUtilsReferences, _glimmerReference) {\n  'use strict';\n\n  /**\n  @module ember\n  @submodule ember-glimmer\n  */\n\n  /**\n    Dynamically look up a property on an object.

you pass a `readonly` binding from an outer context (e.g. parent component),\n    to to an inner context (e.g. child component), you are saying that changing that\n    property in the inner context does not change the value in the outer context.\n  \n    To specify that a binding is read-only, when invoking the child `Component`:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-parent.js\n    export default Component.extend({\n      totalClicks: 3\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs\n    {{log totalClicks}} // -> 3\n    {{my-child childClickCount=(readonly

this.incrementProperty('childClickCount');\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    The value updates in the child component, but not the parent component:\n  \n

number, string),\n    only the reference to the object is protected using the readonly helper.\n    This means that you can change properties of the object both on the parent component, as well as the child component.\n    The `readonly` binding behaves similar to the `const` keyword in JavaScript.\n  \n    Let's look at an example:\n  \n    First let's set up the parent component:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-parent.js\n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      clicks: null,\n  \n      init() {\n        this._super(...arguments);\n        this.set('clicks', { total: 3 });\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs\n    {{log clicks.total}} //-> 3\n    {{my-child childClicks=(readonly clicks)}}\n    ```\n  \n    Now, if you update the `total` property of `childClicks`:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-child.js\n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      click() {\n        this.get('clicks').incrementProperty('total');\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    You will see the following happen:\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs\n    {{log clicks.total}} //-> 4\n    {{my-child childClicks=(readonly clicks)}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/my-child.hbs\n    {{log childClicks.total}} //-> 4\n    ```\n  \n    @method readonly\n    @param {Object} [attr] the read-only attribute.\n    @for

For example, given a component with the property \"name\",\n    that component's template can use the name in several ways:\n  \n    ```app/components/person.js\n      export default Ember.Component.extend({\n        name: 'Jill'\n      });\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/components/person.hbs\n    {{name}}\n    <div>{{name}}</div>\n    <span data-name={{name}}></span>\n    ```\n  \n    Any time the \"name\" property on the component changes, the DOM will be\n    updated.\n  \n    Properties can be chained as well:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{aUserModel.name}}\n    <div>{{listOfUsers.firstObject.name}}</div>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Using Ember helpers\n  \n    When content is passed in mustaches `{{}}`, Ember will first try to find a helper\n    or component with that name. For example, the `if` helper:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{if name \"I have a name\" \"I have no name\"}}\n    <span data-has-name={{if name true}}></span>\n    ```\n  \n    The returned value is placed where the `{{}}` is called. The above style is\n    called \"inline\". A second style of helper usage is called \"block\". For example:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#if name}}\n    I have a name\n    {{else}}\n    I have no name\n    {{/if}}\n    ```\n  \n    The block form of helpers allows you to control how the UI is created based\n    on the values of properties.\n    A third form of helper is called \"nested\". For example here the concat\n    helper will add \" Doe\" to a displayed name if the person has no last name:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <span data-name={{concat firstName (\n    if lastName (concat \" \" lastName) \"Doe\"\n    )}}></span>\n    ```\n  \n    Ember's built-in helpers are described under the [Ember.Templates.helpers](/api/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers.html)\n    namespace. Documentation on creating custom helpers can be found under\n    [Ember.Helper](/api/classes/Ember.Helper.html).\n  \n    ### Invoking a Component\n  \n    Ember components represent state to the UI of an application.

rendered.  For more info,\n    see the [Ember.TextField](/api/classes/Ember.TextField.html) docs and\n    the [templates guide](http://emberjs.com/guides/templates/input-helpers/).\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{input value=\"987\"}}\n    ```\n  \n    renders as:\n  \n    ```HTML\n    <input type=\"text\" value=\"987\" />\n    ```\n  \n    ### Text field\n  \n    If no `type` option is specified, a default of type 'text' is used.\n    Many of the standard HTML attributes may be passed to this helper.\n    <table>\n      <tr><td>`readonly`</td><td>`required`</td><td>`autofocus`</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>`value`</td><td>`placeholder`</td><td>`disabled`</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>`size`</td><td>`tabindex`</td><td>`maxlength`</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>`name`</td><td>`min`</td><td>`max`</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>`pattern`</td><td>`accept`</td><td>`autocomplete`</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>`autosave`</td><td>`formaction`</td><td>`formenctype`</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>`formmethod`</td><td>`formnovalidate`</td><td>`formtarget`</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>`height`</td><td>`inputmode`</td><td>`multiple`</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>`step`</td><td>`width`</td><td>`form`</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>`selectionDirection`</td><td>`spellcheck`</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>\n    </table>\n    When set to a quoted string, these values will be directly applied to the HTML\n    element. When left unquoted, these values will be bound to a property on the\n    template's current rendering context (most typically a controller instance).\n    A very common use of this helper is to bind the `value` of an input to an Object's attribute:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    Search:\n    {{input value=searchWord}}\n    ```\n  \n    In this example, the inital value in the `<input />` will be set to the value of `searchWord`.\n    If the user changes the text, the value of `searchWord` will also be updated.\n  \n    ### Actions\n  \n    The helper can send multiple actions based on user events.\n    The action property defines the action which is sent when\n    the user presses the return key.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{input action=\"submit\"}}\n    ```\n  \n    The helper allows some user events to send actions.\n  \n    * `enter`\n    * `insert-newline`\n    * `escape-press`\n    * `focus-in`\n    * `focus-out`\n    * `key-press`\n    * `key-up`\n  \n    For example, if you desire an action to be sent when the input is blurred,\n    you only need to setup the action name to the event name property.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{input focus-out=\"alertMessage\"}}\n    ```\n    See more about [Text Support Actions](/api/classes/Ember.TextField.html)\n  \n    ### Extending `Ember.TextField`\n  \n    Internally, `{{input type=\"text\"}}` creates an instance of `Ember.TextField`, passing\n    arguments from the helper to `Ember.TextField`'s `create` method. You can extend the\n    capabilities of text inputs in your applications by reopening this class. For example,\n    if you are building a Bootstrap project where `data-*` attributes are used, you\n    can add one to the `TextField`'s `attributeBindings` property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    Ember.TextField.reopen({\n      attributeBindings: ['data-error']\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Keep in mind when writing `Ember.TextField` subclasses that `Ember.TextField`\n    itself extends `Ember.Component`. Expect isolated component semantics, not\n    legacy 1.x view semantics (like `controller` being present).\n    See more about [Ember components](/api/classes/Ember.Component.html)\n  \n    ### Checkbox\n  \n    Checkboxes are special forms of the `{{input}}` helper.  To create a `<checkbox />`:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    Emberize Everything:\n    {{input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"isEmberized\" checked=isEmberized}}\n    ```\n  \n    This will bind checked state of this checkbox to the value of `isEmberized`  -- if either one changes,\n    it will be reflected in the other.\n  \n    The following HTML attributes can be set via the helper:\n  \n    * `checked`\n    * `disabled`\n    * `tabindex`\n    * `indeterminate`\n    * `name`\n    * `autofocus`\n    * `form`\n  \n    ### Extending `Ember.Checkbox`\n  \n    Internally, `{{input type=\"checkbox\"}}` creates an instance of `Ember.Checkbox`, passing\n    arguments from the helper to `Ember.Checkbox`'s `create` method. You can extend the\n    capablilties of checkbox inputs in your applications by reopening this class. For example,\n    if you wanted to add a css class to all checkboxes in your application:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    Ember.Checkbox.reopen({\n      classNames: ['my-app-checkbox']\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method input\n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @param {Hash} options\n    @public\n  */\n\n  function inputMacro(path, params, hash, builder) {\n    var keys = undefined;\n    var values = undefined;\n    var typeIndex = -1;\n    var valueIndex = -1;\n\n    if (hash) {\n      keys = hash[0];\n      values = hash[1];\n      typeIndex = keys.indexOf('type');\n      valueIndex = keys.indexOf('value');\n    }\n\n    if (!params) {\n      params = [];\n    }\n\n    if (typeIndex > -1) {\n      var typeArg = values[typeIndex];\n      if (!Array.isArray(typeArg)) {\n        if (typeArg === 'checkbox') {\n\n          _emberGlimmerUtilsBindings.wrapComponentClassAttribute(hash);\n\n          var definition = builder.env.getComponentDefinition(['-checkbox'], builder.symbolTable);\n          builder.component.static(definition, [params, hash, null, null], builder.symbolTable);\n          return true;\n        } else {\n          return buildTextFieldSyntax(params, hash, builder);\n        }\n      }\n    } else {\n      return buildTextFieldSyntax(params, hash, builder);\n    }\n\n    return _emberGlimmerSyntaxDynamicComponent.dynamicComponentMacro(params, hash, null, null, builder);\n  }\n});\nenifed('ember-glimmer/syntax/mount', ['exports', '@glimmer/runtime', '@glimmer/reference', 'ember-debug', 'ember-glimmer/utils/references', 'ember-routing', 'ember-glimmer/syntax/outlet', 'container', 'ember-glimmer/syntax/abstract-manager'], function (exports, _glimmerRuntime, _glimmerReference, _emberDebug, _emberGlimmerUtilsReferences, _emberRouting, _emberGlimmerSyntaxOutlet, _container, _emberGlimmerSyntaxAbstractManager) {\n  /**\n  @module ember\n  @submodule ember-glimmer\n  */\n  'use strict';\n\n  exports.mountMacro = mountMacro;\n\n  function dynamicEngineFor(vm, symbolTable) {\n    var env = vm.env;\n    var args = vm.getArgs();\n    var nameRef = args.positional.at(0);\n\n    return new DynamicEngineReference({ nameRef: nameRef, env: env, symbolTable: symbolTable });\n  }\n\n  /**\n    The `{{mount}}` helper lets you embed a routeless engine in a template.\n    Mounting an engine will cause an instance to be booted and its `application`\n    template to be rendered.\n  \n    For example, the following template mounts the `ember-chat` engine:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{!

also will be used.\n    Note: A given controller may only be used *once* in your app in this manner.\n    A singleton instance of the controller will be created for you.\n  \n    Example:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    App.NavigationController = Ember.Controller.extend({\n      who: \"world\"\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <!-- navigation.hbs -->\n    Hello, {{who}}.\n    ```\n  \n

world.\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    Optionally you may provide a second argument: a property path\n    that will be bound to the `model` property of the controller.\n    If a `model` property path is specified, then a new instance of the\n    controller will be created and `{{render}}` can be used multiple times\n    with the same name.\n  \n    For example if you had this `author` template.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div class=\"author\">\n      Written by {{firstName}} {{lastName}}.\n      Total Posts: {{postCount}}\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    You could render it inside the `post` template using the `render` helper.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div class=\"post\">\n      <h1>{{title}}</h1>\n      <div>{{body}}</div>\n      {{render \"author\" author}}\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n

The value of this property should be a string representing a path\n    to another object or a custom binding instance created using Binding helpers\n    (see \"One Way Bindings\"):\n  \n    ```\n    valueBinding: \"MyApp.someController.title\"\n    ```\n  \n    This will create a binding from `MyApp.someController.title` to the `value`\n    property of your object instance automatically. Now the two values will be\n    kept in sync.\n  \n    ## One Way Bindings\n  \n    One especially useful binding customization you can use is the `oneWay()`\n    helper. This helper tells Ember that you are only interested in\n    receiving changes on the object you are binding from. For example, if you\n    are binding to a preference and you want to be notified if the preference\n    has changed, but your object will not be changing the preference itself, you\n    could do:\n  \n    ```\n    bigTitlesBinding: Ember.Binding.oneWay(\"MyApp.preferencesController.bigTitles\")\n    ```\n  \n    This way if the value of `MyApp.preferencesController.bigTitles` changes the\n    `bigTitles` property of your object will change also. However, if you\n    change the value of your `bigTitles` property, it will not update the\n    `preferencesController`.\n  \n    One way bindings are almost twice as fast to setup and twice as fast to\n    execute because the binding only has to worry about changes to one side.\n  \n    You should consider using one way bindings anytime you have an object that\n    may be created frequently and you do not intend to change a property; only\n    to monitor it for changes (such as in the example above).\n  \n    ## Adding Bindings Manually\n  \n    All of the examples above show you how to configure a custom binding, but the\n    result of these customizations will be a binding template, not a fully active\n    Binding instance. The binding will actually become active only when you\n    instantiate the object the binding belongs to. It is useful, however, to\n    understand what actually happens when the binding is activated.\n  \n    For a binding to function it must have at least a `from` property and a `to`\n    property. The `from` property path points to the object/key that you want to\n    bind from while the `to` path points to the object/key you want to bind to.\n  \n    When you define a custom binding, you are usually describing the property\n    you want to bind from (such as `MyApp.someController.value` in the examples\n    above). When your object is created, it will automatically assign the value\n    you want to bind `to` based on the name of your binding key. In the\n    examples above, during init, Ember objects will effectively call\n    something like this on your binding:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    binding = Ember.Binding.from(\"valueBinding\").to(\"value\");\n    ```\n  \n    This creates a new binding instance based on the template you provide, and\n    sets the to path to the `value` property of the new object. Now that the\n    binding is fully configured with a `from` and a `to`, it simply needs to be\n    connected to become active. This is done through the `connect()` method:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    binding.connect(this);\n    ```\n  \n    Note that when you connect a binding you pass the object you want it to be\n    connected to. This object will be used as the root for both the from and\n    to side of the binding when inspecting relative paths. This allows the\n    binding to be automatically inherited by subclassed objects as well.\n  \n    This also allows you to bind between objects using the paths you declare in\n    `from` and `to`:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    // Example 1\n    binding = Ember.Binding.from(\"App.someObject.value\").to(\"value\");\n    binding.connect(this);\n  \n    // Example 2\n    binding = Ember.Binding.from(\"parentView.value\").to(\"App.someObject.value\");\n    binding.connect(this);\n    ```\n  \n    Now that the binding is connected, it will observe both the from and to side\n    and relay changes.\n  \n    If you ever needed to do so (you almost never will, but it is useful to\n    understand this anyway), you could manually create an active binding by\n    using the `Ember.bind()` helper method. (This is the same method used by\n    to setup your bindings on objects):\n  \n    ```javascript\n    Ember.bind(MyApp.anotherObject, \"value\", \"MyApp.someController.value\");\n    ```\n  \n    Both of these code fragments have the same effect as doing the most friendly\n    form of binding creation like so:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    MyApp.anotherObject = Ember.Object.create({\n      valueBinding: \"MyApp.someController.value\",\n  \n      // OTHER CODE FOR THIS OBJECT...\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Ember's built in binding creation method makes it easy to automatically\n    create bindings for you. You should always use the highest-level APIs\n    available, even if you understand how it works underneath.\n  \n    @class Binding\n    @namespace Ember\n    @since Ember 0.9\n    @public\n  */\n  // Ember.Binding = Binding; ES6TODO: where to put this?\n\n  /**\n    Global helper method to create a new binding.

You can specify various properties\n    that your computed property depends on. This will force the cached\n    result to be recomputed if the dependencies are modified.\n  \n    In the following example we declare a computed property - `fullName` - by calling\n    `.Ember.computed()` with property dependencies (`firstName` and `lastName`) as leading arguments and getter accessor function. The `fullName` getter function\n    will be called once (regardless of how many times it is accessed) as long\n    as its dependencies have not changed. Once `firstName` or `lastName` are updated\n    any future calls (or anything bound) to `fullName` will incorporate the new\n    values.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let Person = Ember.Object.extend({\n      // these will be supplied by `create`\n      firstName: null,\n      lastName: null,\n  \n      fullName: Ember.computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {\n        let firstName = this.get('firstName'),\n            lastName  = this.get('lastName');\n  \n        return firstName + ' ' + lastName;\n      })\n    });\n  \n    let tom = Person.create({\n      firstName: 'Tom',\n      lastName: 'Dale'\n    });\n  \n    tom.get('fullName') // 'Tom Dale'\n    ```\n  \n    You can also define what Ember should do when setting a computed property by providing additional function (`set`) in hash argument.\n    If you try to set a computed property, it will try to invoke setter accessor function with the key and\n    value you want to set it to as arguments.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let Person = Ember.Object.extend({\n      // these will be supplied by `create`\n      firstName: null,\n      lastName: null,\n  \n      fullName: Ember.computed('firstName', 'lastName', {\n        get(key) {\n          let firstName = this.get('firstName'),\n              lastName  = this.get('lastName');\n  \n          return firstName + ' ' + lastName;\n        },\n        set(key, value) {\n          let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(' ');\n  \n          this.set('firstName', firstName);\n          this.set('lastName', lastName);\n  \n          return value;\n        }\n      })\n    });\n  \n    let person = Person.create();\n  \n    person.set('fullName', 'Peter Wagenet');\n    person.get('firstName'); // 'Peter'\n    person.get('lastName');  // 'Wagenet'\n    ```\n  \n    You can overwrite computed property with normal property (no longer computed), that won't change if dependencies change, if you set computed property and it won't have setter accessor function defined.\n  \n    You can also mark computed property as `.readOnly()` and block all attempts to set it.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let Person = Ember.Object.extend({\n      // these will be supplied by `create`\n      firstName: null,\n      lastName: null,\n  \n      fullName: Ember.computed('firstName', 'lastName', {\n        get(key) {\n          let firstName = this.get('firstName');\n          let lastName  = this.get('lastName');\n  \n          return firstName + ' ' + lastName;\n        }\n      }).readOnly()\n    });\n  \n    let person = Person.create();\n    person.set('fullName', 'Peter Wagenet'); // Uncaught Error: Cannot set read-only property \"fullName\" on object: <(...):emberXXX>\n    ```\n  \n    Additional resources:\n    - [New CP syntax RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0011-improved-cp-syntax.md)\n    - [New computed syntax explained in \"Ember 1.12 released\" ](http://emberjs.com/blog/2015/05/13/ember-1-12-released.html#toc_new-computed-syntax)\n  \n    @class ComputedProperty\n    @namespace Ember\n    @public\n  */\n  function ComputedProperty(config, opts) {\n    this.isDescriptor = true;\n    if (typeof config === 'function') {\n      this._getter = config;\n    } else {\n      this._getter = config.get;\n      this._setter = config.set;\n    }\n\n    this._dependentKeys = undefined;\n    this._suspended = undefined;\n    this._meta = undefined;\n    this._volatile = false;\n    this._dependentKeys = opts && opts.dependentKeys;\n    this._readOnly = false;\n  }\n\n  ComputedProperty.prototype = new _emberMetalProperties.Descriptor();\n  ComputedProperty.prototype.constructor = ComputedProperty;\n\n  var ComputedPropertyPrototype = ComputedProperty.prototype;\n\n  /**\n    Call on a computed property to set it into non-cached mode.

passed\n    computed property function. You can use this helper to define properties\n    with mixins or via `Ember.defineProperty()`.\n  \n    If you pass a function as an argument, it will be used as a getter. A computed\n    property defined in this way might look like this:\n  \n    ```js\n    let Person = Ember.Object.extend({\n      init() {\n        this._super(...arguments);\n  \n        this.firstName = 'Betty';\n        this.lastName = 'Jones';\n      },\n  \n      fullName: Ember.computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {\n        return `${this.get('firstName')} ${this.get('lastName')}`;\n      })\n    });\n  \n    let client = Person.create();\n  \n    client.get('fullName'); // 'Betty Jones'\n  \n    client.set('lastName', 'Fuller');\n    client.get('fullName'); // 'Betty Fuller'\n    ```\n  \n    You can pass a hash with two functions, `get` and `set`, as an\n    argument to provide both a getter and setter:\n  \n    ```js\n    let Person = Ember.Object.extend({\n      init() {\n        this._super(...arguments);\n  \n        this.firstName = 'Betty';\n        this.lastName = 'Jones';\n      },\n  \n      fullName: Ember.computed('firstName', 'lastName', {\n        get(key) {\n          return `${this.get('firstName')} ${this.get('lastName')}`;\n        },\n        set(key, value) {\n          let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(/\\s+/);\n          this.setProperties({ firstName, lastName });\n          return value;\n        }\n      })\n    });\n  \n    let client = Person.create();\n    client.get('firstName'); // 'Betty'\n  \n    client.set('fullName', 'Carroll Fuller');\n    client.get('firstName'); // 'Carroll'\n    ```\n  \n    The `set` function should accept two parameters, `key` and `value`. The value\n    returned from `set` will be the new value of the property.\n  \n    _Note: This is the preferred way to define computed properties when writing third-party\n    libraries that depend on or use Ember, since there is no guarantee that the user\n    will have [prototype Extensions](http://emberjs.com/guides/configuring-ember/disabling-prototype-extensions/) enabled._\n  \n    The alternative syntax, with prototype extensions, might look like:\n  \n    ```js\n    fullName: function() {\n      return this.get('firstName') + ' ' + this.get('lastName');\n    }.property('firstName', 'lastName')\n    ```\n  \n    @class computed\n    @namespace Ember\n    @constructor\n    @static\n    @param {String} [dependentKeys*] Optional dependent keys that trigger this computed property.\n    @param {Function} func The computed property function.\n    @return {Ember.ComputedProperty} property descriptor instance\n    @public\n  */\n\n  function computed(func) {\n    var args = undefined;\n\n    if (arguments.length > 1) {\n      args = [].slice.call(arguments);\n      func = args.pop();\n    }\n\n    var cp = new ComputedProperty(func);\n\n    if (args) {\n      cp.property.apply(cp, args);\n    }\n\n    return cp;\n  }\n\n  /**\n    Returns the cached value for a property, if one exists.\n    This can be useful for peeking at the value of a computed\n    property that is generated lazily, without accidentally causing\n    it to be created.\n  \n    @method cacheFor\n    @for Ember\n    @param {Object} obj the object whose property you want to check\n    @param {String} key the name of the property whose cached value you want\n      to return\n    @return {Object} the cached value\n    @public\n  */\n  function cacheFor(obj, key) {\n    var meta = _emberMetalMeta.peekMeta(obj);\n    var cache = meta && meta.source === obj && meta.readableCache();\n    var ret = cache && cache[key];\n\n    if (ret === _emberMetalMeta.UNDEFINED) {\n      return undefined;\n    }\n    return ret;\n  }\n\n  cacheFor.set = function (cache, key, value) {\n    if (value === undefined) {\n      cache[key] = _emberMetalMeta.UNDEFINED;\n    } else {\n      cache[key] = value;\n    }\n  };\n\n  cacheFor.get = function (cache, key) {\n    var ret = cache[key];\n    if (ret === _emberMetalMeta.UNDEFINED) {\n      return undefined;\n    }\n    return ret;\n  };\n\n  cacheFor.remove = function (cache, key) {\n    cache[key] = undefined;\n  };\n\n  exports.ComputedProperty = ComputedProperty;\n  exports.computed = computed;\n  exports.cacheFor = cacheFor;\n});\nenifed('ember-metal/core', ['exports', 'ember-environment'], function (exports, _emberEnvironment) {\n  'use strict';\n\n  /**\n  @module ember\n  @submodule ember-metal\n  */\n\n  /**\n    This namespace contains all Ember methods and functions.

This is equivalent to calling\n    `run.later` with a wait time of 1ms.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    run.next(myContext, function() {\n      // code to be executed in the next run loop,\n      // which will be scheduled after the current one\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Multiple operations scheduled with `run.next` will coalesce\n    into the same later run loop, along with any other operations\n    scheduled by `run.later` that expire right around the same\n    time that `run.next` operations will fire.\n  \n    Note that there are often alternatives to using `run.next`.\n    For instance, if you'd like to schedule an operation to happen\n    after all DOM element operations have completed within the current\n    run loop, you can make use of the `afterRender` run loop queue (added\n    by the `ember-views` package, along with the preceding `render` queue\n    where all the DOM element operations happen).\n  \n    Example:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    export default Ember.Component.extend({\n      didInsertElement() {\n        this._super(...arguments);\n        run.scheduleOnce('afterRender', this, 'processChildElements');\n      },\n  \n      processChildElements() {\n        // ... do something with component's child component\n        // elements after they've finished rendering, which\n        // can't be done within this component's\n        // `didInsertElement` hook because that gets run\n        // before the child elements have been added to the DOM.\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    One benefit of the above approach compared to using `run.next` is\n    that you will be able to perform DOM/CSS operations before unprocessed\n    elements are rendered to the screen, which may prevent flickering or\n    other artifacts caused by delaying processing until after rendering.\n  \n    The other major benefit to the above approach is that `run.next`\n    introduces an element of non-determinism, which can make things much\n    harder to test, due to its reliance on `setTimeout`; it's much harder\n    to guarantee the order of scheduled operations when they are scheduled\n    outside of the current run loop, i.e. with `run.next`.\n  \n    @method next\n    @param {Object} [target] target of method to invoke\n    @param {Function|String} method The method to invoke.\n      If you pass a string it will be resolved on the\n      target at the time the method is invoked.\n    @param {Object} [args*] Optional arguments to pass to the timeout.\n    @return {Object} Timer information for use in cancelling, see `run.cancel`.\n    @public\n  */\n  run.next = function () {\n    for (var _len4 = arguments.length, args = Array(_len4), _key4 = 0; _key4 < _len4; _key4++) {\n      args[_key4] = arguments[_key4];\n    }\n\n    args.push(1);\n    return backburner.later.apply(backburner, args);\n  };\n\n  /**\n    Cancels a scheduled item.

This relies upon the browser's `history` API.\n  \n    Example:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    App.Router.map(function() {\n      this.route('posts', function() {\n        this.route('new');\n      });\n    });\n  \n    App.Router.reopen({\n      location: 'history'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    This will result in a posts.new url of `/posts/new`.\n  \n    Keep in mind that your server must serve the Ember app at all the routes you\n    define.\n  \n    ### AutoLocation\n  \n    Using `AutoLocation`, the router will use the best Location class supported by\n    the browser it is running in.\n  \n    Browsers that support the `history` API will use `HistoryLocation`, those that\n    do not, but still support the `hashchange` event will use `HashLocation`, and\n    in the rare case neither is supported will use `NoneLocation`.\n  \n    Example:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    App.Router.map(function() {\n      this.route('posts', function() {\n        this.route('new');\n      });\n    });\n  \n    App.Router.reopen({\n      location: 'auto'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    This will result in a posts.new url of `/posts/new` for modern browsers that\n    support the `history` api or `/#/posts/new` for older ones, like Internet\n    Explorer 9 and below.\n  \n    When a user visits a link to your application, they will be automatically\n    upgraded or downgraded to the appropriate `Location` class, with the URL\n    transformed accordingly, if needed.\n  \n    Keep in mind that since some of your users will use `HistoryLocation`, your\n    server must serve the Ember app at all the routes you define.\n  \n    ### NoneLocation\n  \n    Using `NoneLocation` causes Ember to not store the applications URL state\n    in the actual URL. This is generally used for testing purposes, and is one\n    of the changes made when calling `App.setupForTesting()`.\n  \n    ## Location API\n  \n    Each location implementation must provide the following methods:\n  \n    * implementation: returns the string name used to reference the implementation.\n    * getURL: returns the current URL.\n    * setURL(path): sets the current URL.\n    * replaceURL(path): replace the current URL (optional).\n    * onUpdateURL(callback): triggers the callback when the URL changes.\n    * formatURL(url): formats `url` to be placed into `href` attribute.\n    * detect() (optional): instructs the location to do any feature detection\n        necessary. If the location needs to redirect to a different URL, it\n        can cancel routing by setting the `cancelRouterSetup` property on itself\n        to `false`.\n  \n    Calling setURL or replaceURL will not trigger onUpdateURL callbacks.\n  \n    ## Custom implementation\n  \n    Ember scans `app/locations/*` for extending the Location API.\n  \n    Example:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Ember from 'ember';\n  \n    export default Ember.HistoryLocation.extend({\n      implementation: 'history-url-logging',\n  \n      pushState: function (path) {\n        console.log(path);\n        this._super.apply(this, arguments);\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @class Location\n    @namespace Ember\n    @static\n    @private\n  */\n  exports.default = {\n    /**\n     This is deprecated in favor of using the container to lookup the location\n     implementation as desired.\n      For example:\n      ```javascript\n     // Given a location registered as follows:\n     container.register('location:history-test', HistoryTestLocation);\n      // You could create a new instance via:\n     container.lookup('location:history-test');\n     ```\n       @method create\n      @param {Object} options\n      @return {Object} an instance of an implementation of the `location` API\n      @deprecated Use the container to lookup the location implementation that you\n      need.\n      @private\n    */\n    create: function (options) {\n      var implementation = options && options.implementation;\n\n      var implementationClass = this.implementations[implementation];\n\n      return implementationClass.create.apply(implementationClass, arguments);\n    },\n\n    implementations: {},\n    _location: _emberEnvironment.environment.location,\n\n    /**\n      Returns the current `location.hash` by parsing location.href since browsers\n      inconsistently URL-decode `location.hash`.\n       https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=483304\n       @private\n      @method getHash\n      @since 1.4.0\n    */\n    _getHash: function () {\n      return _emberRoutingLocationUtil.getHash(this.location);\n    }\n  };\n});\nenifed('ember-routing/location/auto_location', ['exports', 'ember-utils', 'ember-metal', 'ember-debug', 'ember-runtime', 'ember-environment', 'ember-routing/location/util'], function (exports, _emberUtils, _emberMetal, _emberDebug, _emberRuntime, _emberEnvironment, _emberRoutingLocationUtil) {\n  'use strict';\n\n  exports.getHistoryPath = getHistoryPath;\n  exports.getHashPath = getHashPath;\n\n  /**\n  @module ember\n  @submodule ember-routing\n  */\n\n  /**\n    Ember.AutoLocation will select the best location option based off browser\n    support with the priority order: history, hash, none.\n  \n    Clean pushState paths accessed by hashchange-only browsers will be redirected\n    to the hash-equivalent and vice versa so future transitions are consistent.\n  \n    Keep in mind that since some of your users will use `HistoryLocation`, your\n    server must serve the Ember app at all the routes you define.\n  \n    @class AutoLocation\n    @namespace Ember\n    @static\n    @private\n  */\n  exports.default = _emberRuntime.Object.extend({\n    /**\n      @private\n       The browser's `location` object.

This is handy for preventing extremely long route names.\n          Keep in mind that the actual URL path behavior is still retained.\n       The third parameter is a function, which can be used to nest routes.\n      Nested routes, by default, will have the parent route tree's route name and\n      path prepended to it's own.\n       ```javascript\n      App.Router.map(function(){\n        this.route('post', { path: '/post/:post_id' }, function() {\n          this.route('edit');\n          this.route('comments', { resetNamespace: true }, function() {\n            this.route('new');\n          });\n        });\n      });\n      ```\n       For more detailed documentation and examples please see\n      [the guides](http://emberjs.com/guides/routing/defining-your-routes/).\n       @method map\n      @param callback\n      @public\n    */\n    map: function (callback) {\n      if (!this.dslCallbacks) {\n        this.dslCallbacks = [];\n        this.reopenClass({ dslCallbacks: this.dslCallbacks });\n      }\n\n      this.dslCallbacks.push(callback);\n\n      return this;\n    },\n\n    _routePath: function (handlerInfos) {\n      var path = [];\n\n      // We have to handle coalescing resource names that\n      // are prefixed with their parent's names, e.g.\n      // ['foo', 'foo.bar.baz'] => 'foo.bar.baz', not 'foo.foo.bar.baz'\n\n      function intersectionMatches(a1, a2) {\n        for (var i = 0; i < a1.length; ++i) {\n          if (a1[i] !== a2[i]) {\n            return false;\n          }\n        }\n        return true;\n      }\n\n      var name = undefined,\n          nameParts = undefined,\n          oldNameParts = undefined;\n      for (var i = 1; i < handlerInfos.length; i++) {\n        name = handlerInfos[i].name;\n        nameParts = name.split('.');\n        oldNameParts = slice.call(path);\n\n        while (oldNameParts.length) {\n          if (intersectionMatches(oldNameParts, nameParts)) {\n            break;\n          }\n          oldNameParts.shift();\n        }\n\n        path.push.apply(path, nameParts.slice(oldNameParts.length));\n      }\n\n      return path.join('.');\n    }\n  });\n\n  function didBeginTransition(transition, router) {\n    var routerState = _emberRoutingSystemRouter_state.default.create({\n      emberRouter: router,\n      routerJs: router._routerMicrolib,\n      routerJsState: transition.state\n    });\n\n    if (!router.currentState) {\n      router.set('currentState', routerState);\n    }\n    router.set('targetState', routerState);\n\n    transition.promise = transition.catch(function (error) {\n      var errorId = _emberUtils.guidFor(error);\n\n      if (router._isErrorHandled(errorId)) {\n        router._clearHandledError(errorId);\n      } else {\n        throw error;\n      }\n    });\n  }\n\n  function resemblesURL(str) {\n    return typeof str === 'string' && (str === '' || str[0] === '/');\n  }\n\n  function forEachQueryParam(router, handlerInfos, queryParams, callback) {\n    var qpCache = router._queryParamsFor(handlerInfos);\n\n    for (var key in queryParams) {\n      if (!queryParams.hasOwnProperty(key)) {\n        continue;\n      }\n      var value = queryParams[key];\n      var qp = qpCache.map[key];\n\n      callback(key, value, qp);\n    }\n  }\n\n  function findLiveRoute(liveRoutes, name) {\n    if (!liveRoutes) {\n      return;\n    }\n    var stack = [liveRoutes];\n    while (stack.length > 0) {\n      var test = stack.shift();\n      if (test.render.name === name) {\n        return test;\n      }\n      var outlets = test.outlets;\n      for (var outletName in outlets) {\n        stack.push(outlets[outletName]);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  function appendLiveRoute(liveRoutes, defaultParentState, renderOptions) {\n    var target = undefined;\n    var myState = {\n      render: renderOptions,\n      outlets: Object.create(null),\n      wasUsed: false\n    };\n    if (renderOptions.into) {\n      target = findLiveRoute(liveRoutes, renderOptions.into);\n    } else {\n      target = defaultParentState;\n    }\n    if (target) {\n      _emberMetal.set(target.outlets, renderOptions.outlet, myState);\n    } else {\n      if (renderOptions.into) {\n\n        // Megahax time.

To continue bubbling the action,\n      you must return `true` from the handler:\n       ```js\n      App.Router.map(function() {\n        this.route(\"album\", function() {\n          this.route(\"song\");\n        });\n      });\n       App.AlbumRoute = Ember.Route.extend({\n        actions: {\n          startPlaying: function() {\n          }\n        }\n      });\n       App.AlbumSongRoute = Ember.Route.extend({\n        actions: {\n          startPlaying() {\n            // ...\n             if (actionShouldAlsoBeTriggeredOnParentRoute) {\n              return true;\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       @property actions\n      @type Object\n      @default null\n      @public\n    */\n\n    /**\n      Triggers a named action on the `ActionHandler`.

It is not a\n    concrete implementation, but it can be used up by other classes that want\n    to appear like arrays.\n  \n    For example, ArrayProxy is a concrete classes that can\n    be instantiated to implement array-like behavior. Both of these classes use\n    the Array Mixin by way of the MutableArray mixin, which allows observable\n    changes to be made to the underlying array.\n  \n    Unlike `Ember.Enumerable,` this mixin defines methods specifically for\n    collections that provide index-ordered access to their contents. When you\n    are designing code that needs to accept any kind of Array-like object, you\n    should use these methods instead of Array primitives because these will\n    properly notify observers of changes to the array.\n  \n    Although these methods are efficient, they do add a layer of indirection to\n    your application so it is a good idea to use them only when you need the\n    flexibility of using both true JavaScript arrays and \"virtual\" arrays such\n    as controllers and collections.\n  \n    You can use the methods defined in this module to access and modify array\n    contents in a KVO-friendly way. You can also be notified whenever the\n    membership of an array changes by using `.observes('myArray.[]')`.\n  \n    To support `Ember.Array` in your own class, you must override two\n    primitives to use it: `length()` and `objectAt()`.\n  \n    Note that the Ember.Array mixin also incorporates the `Ember.Enumerable`\n    mixin.

You must have a length property. This property should change whenever\n       the number of items in your enumerable object changes.

This is often where the most common API conflicts occur.\n    Ember's API is designed to be as friendly as possible with other\n    libraries by implementing only methods that mostly correspond to the\n    JavaScript 1.8 API.\n  \n    @class Enumerable\n    @namespace Ember\n    @since Ember 0.9\n    @private\n  */\n  var Enumerable = _emberMetal.Mixin.create({\n\n    /**\n      __Required.__ You must implement this method to apply this mixin.\n       Implement this method to make your class enumerable.\n       This method will be called repeatedly during enumeration.

This is a useful way to\n      manage iteration if you are tracing a linked list, for example.\n       Finally the context parameter will always contain a hash you can use as\n      a \"scratchpad\" to maintain any other state you need in order to iterate\n      properly.

Once an object is frozen it should be read only. No changes\n    may be made the internal state of the object.\n  \n    ## Enforcement\n  \n    To fully support freezing in your subclass, you must include this mixin and\n    override any method that might alter any property on the object to instead\n    raise an exception. You can check the state of an object by checking the\n    `isFrozen` property.\n  \n    Although future versions of JavaScript may support language-level freezing\n    object objects, that is not the case today. Even if an object is freezable,\n    it is still technically possible to modify the object, even though it could\n    break other parts of your application that do not expect a frozen object to\n    change. It is, therefore, very important that you always respect the\n    `isFrozen` property on all freezable objects.\n  \n    ## Example Usage\n  \n    The example below shows a simple object that implement the `Ember.Freezable`\n    protocol.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    Contact = Ember.Object.extend(Ember.Freezable, {\n      firstName: null,\n      lastName: null,\n  \n      // swaps the names\n      swapNames: function() {\n        if (this.get('isFrozen')) throw Ember.FROZEN_ERROR;\n        var tmp = this.get('firstName');\n        this.set('firstName', this.get('lastName'));\n        this.set('lastName', tmp);\n        return this;\n      }\n  \n    });\n  \n    c = Contact.create({ firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Doe\" });\n    c.swapNames();  // returns c\n    c.freeze();\n    c.swapNames();  // EXCEPTION\n    ```\n  \n    ## Copying\n  \n    Usually the `Ember.Freezable` protocol is implemented in cooperation with the\n    `Ember.Copyable` protocol, which defines a `frozenCopy()` method that will\n    return a frozen object, if the object implements this method as well.\n  \n    @class Freezable\n    @namespace Ember\n    @since Ember 0.9\n    @deprecated Use `Object.freeze` instead.\n    @private\n  */\n  var Freezable = _emberMetal.Mixin.create({\n\n    init: function () {\n      this._super.apply(this, arguments);\n    },\n\n    /**\n      Set to `true` when the object is frozen.

This is one of the fundamental ways that\n    models, controllers and views communicate with each other in an Ember\n    application.\n  \n    Any object that has this mixin applied can be used in observer\n    operations. That includes `Ember.Object` and most objects you will\n    interact with as you write your Ember application.\n  \n    Note that you will not generally apply this mixin to classes yourself,\n    but you will use the features provided by this module frequently, so it\n    is important to understand how to use it.\n  \n    ## Using `get()` and `set()`\n  \n    Because of Ember's support for bindings and observers, you will always\n    access properties using the get method, and set properties using the\n    set method. This allows the observing objects to be notified and\n    computed properties to be handled properly.\n  \n    More documentation about `get` and `set` are below.\n  \n    ## Observing Property Changes\n  \n    You typically observe property changes simply by using the `Ember.observer`\n    function in classes that you write.\n  \n    For example:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    Ember.Object.extend({\n      valueObserver: Ember.observer('value', function(sender, key, value, rev) {\n        // Executes whenever the \"value\" property changes\n        // See the addObserver method for more information about the callback arguments\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Although this is the most common way to add an observer, this capability\n    is actually built into the `Ember.Object` class on top of two methods\n    defined in this mixin: `addObserver` and `removeObserver`. You can use\n    these two methods to add and remove observers yourself if you need to\n    do so at runtime.\n  \n    To add an observer for a property, call:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    object.addObserver('propertyKey', targetObject, targetAction)\n    ```\n  \n    This will call the `targetAction` method on the `targetObject` whenever\n    the value of the `propertyKey` changes.\n  \n    Note that if `propertyKey` is a computed property, the observer will be\n    called when any of the property dependencies are changed, even if the\n    resulting value of the computed property is unchanged. This is necessary\n    because computed properties are not computed until `get` is called.\n  \n    @class Observable\n    @namespace Ember\n    @public\n  */\n  exports.default = _emberMetal.Mixin.create({\n\n    /**\n      Retrieves the value of a property from the object.\n       This method is usually similar to using `object[keyName]` or `object.keyName`,\n      however it supports both computed properties and the unknownProperty\n      handler.\n       Because `get` unifies the syntax for accessing all these kinds\n      of properties, it can make many refactorings easier, such as replacing a\n      simple property with a computed property, or vice versa.\n       ### Computed Properties\n       Computed properties are methods defined with the `property` modifier\n      declared at the end, such as:\n       ```javascript\n      fullName: Ember.computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {\n        return this.get('firstName') + ' ' + this.get('lastName');\n      })\n      ```\n       When you call `get` on a computed property, the function will be\n      called and the return value will be returned instead of the function\n      itself.\n       ### Unknown Properties\n       Likewise, if you try to call `get` on a property whose value is\n      `undefined`, the `unknownProperty()` method will be called on the object.\n      If this method returns any value other than `undefined`, it will be returned\n      instead. This allows you to implement \"virtual\" properties that are\n      not defined upfront.\n       @method get\n      @param {String} keyName The property to retrieve\n      @return {Object} The property value or undefined.\n      @public\n    */\n    get: function (keyName) {\n      return _emberMetal.get(this, keyName);\n    },\n\n    /**\n      To get the values of multiple properties at once, call `getProperties`\n      with a list of strings or an array:\n       ```javascript\n      record.getProperties('firstName', 'lastName', 'zipCode');\n      // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', zipCode: '10011' }\n      ```\n       is equivalent to:\n       ```javascript\n      record.getProperties(['firstName', 'lastName', 'zipCode']);\n      // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', zipCode: '10011' }\n      ```\n       @method getProperties\n      @param {String...|Array} list of keys to get\n      @return {Object}\n      @public\n    */\n    getProperties: function () {\n      for (var _len = arguments.length, args = Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n        args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n      }\n\n      return _emberMetal.getProperties.apply(undefined, [this].concat(args));\n    },\n\n    /**\n      Sets the provided key or path to the value.\n       ```javascript\n      record.set(\"key\", value);\n      ```\n       This method is generally very similar to calling `object[\"key\"] = value` or\n      `object.key = value`, except that it provides support for computed\n      properties, the `setUnknownProperty()` method and property observers.\n       ### Computed Properties\n       If you try to set a value on a key that has a computed property handler\n      defined (see the `get()` method for an example), then `set()` will call\n      that method, passing both the value and key instead of simply changing\n      the value itself. This is useful for those times when you need to\n      implement a property that is composed of one or more member\n      properties.\n       ### Unknown Properties\n       If you try to set a value on a key that is undefined in the target\n      object, then the `setUnknownProperty()` handler will be called instead. This\n      gives you an opportunity to implement complex \"virtual\" properties that\n      are not predefined on the object. If `setUnknownProperty()` returns\n      undefined, then `set()` will simply set the value on the object.\n       ### Property Observers\n       In addition to changing the property, `set()` will also register a property\n      change with the object. Unless you have placed this call inside of a\n      `beginPropertyChanges()` and `endPropertyChanges(),` any \"local\" observers\n      (i.e. observer methods declared on the same object), will be called\n      immediately.

The `key` is the property that\n      changes. The `value` property is currently reserved and unused. The `rev`\n      is the last property revision of the object when it changed, which you can\n      use to detect if the key value has really changed or not.\n       Usually you will not need the value or revision parameters at\n      the end. In this case, it is common to write observer methods that take\n      only a sender and key value as parameters or, if you aren't interested in\n      any of these values, to write an observer that has no parameters at all.\n       @method addObserver\n      @param {String} key The key to observe\n      @param {Object} target The target object to invoke\n      @param {String|Function} method The method to invoke\n      @public\n    */\n    addObserver: function (key, target, method) {\n      _emberMetal.addObserver(this, key, target, method);\n    },\n\n    /**\n      Remove an observer you have previously registered on this object.

However, there are some cases where it is preferable\n  to build up a property's value by combining the superclass' property\n  value with the subclass' value. An example of this in use within Ember\n  is the `classNames` property of `Ember.View`.\n   Here is some sample code showing the difference between a concatenated\n  property and a normal one:\n   ```javascript\n  const Bar = Ember.Object.extend({\n    // Configure which properties to concatenate\n    concatenatedProperties: ['concatenatedProperty'],\n     someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['bar'],\n    concatenatedProperty: ['bar']\n  });\n   const FooBar = Bar.extend({\n    someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['foo'],\n    concatenatedProperty: ['foo']\n  });\n   let fooBar = FooBar.create();\n  fooBar.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['foo']\n  fooBar.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo']\n  ```\n   This behavior extends to object creation as well. Continuing the\n  above example:\n   ```javascript\n  let fooBar = FooBar.create({\n    someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['baz'],\n    concatenatedProperty: ['baz']\n  })\n  fooBar.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['baz']\n  fooBar.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo', 'baz']\n  ```\n   Adding a single property that is not an array will just add it in the array:\n   ```javascript\n  let fooBar = FooBar.create({\n    concatenatedProperty: 'baz'\n  })\n  view.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo', 'baz']\n  ```\n   Using the `concatenatedProperties` property, we can tell Ember to mix the\n  content of the properties.\n   In `Ember.Component` the `classNames`, `classNameBindings` and\n  `attributeBindings` properties are concatenated.\n   This feature is available for you to use throughout the Ember object model,\n  although typical app developers are likely to use it infrequently.

An example of this in use within Ember\n  is the `queryParams` property of routes.\n   Here is some sample code showing the difference between a merged\n  property and a normal one:\n   ```javascript\n  const Bar = Ember.Object.extend({\n    // Configure which properties are to be merged\n    mergedProperties: ['mergedProperty'],\n     someNonMergedProperty: {\n      nonMerged: 'superclass value of nonMerged'\n    },\n    mergedProperty: {\n      page: { replace: false },\n      limit: { replace: true }\n    }\n  });\n   const FooBar = Bar.extend({\n    someNonMergedProperty: {\n      completelyNonMerged: 'subclass value of nonMerged'\n    },\n    mergedProperty: {\n      limit: { replace: false }\n    }\n  });\n   let fooBar = FooBar.create();\n   fooBar.get('someNonMergedProperty');\n  // => { completelyNonMerged: 'subclass value of nonMerged' }\n  //\n  // Note the entire object, including the nonMerged property of\n  // the superclass object, has been replaced\n   fooBar.get('mergedProperty');\n  // => {\n  //   page: {replace: false},\n  //   limit: {replace: false}\n  // }\n  //\n  // Note the page remains from the superclass, and the\n  // `limit` property's value of `false` has been merged from\n  // the subclass.\n  ```\n   This behavior is not available during object `create` calls. It is only\n  available at `extend` time.\n   In `Ember.Route` the `queryParams` property is merged.\n   This feature is available for you to use throughout the Ember object model,\n  although typical app developers are likely to use it infrequently. Since\n  it changes expectations about behavior of properties, you should properly\n  document its usage in each individual merged property (to not\n  mislead your users to think they can override the property in a subclass).\n   @property mergedProperties\n  @type Array\n  @default null\n  @public\n*/\n\n/**\n  Destroyed object property flag.\n   if this property is `true` the observers and bindings were already\n  removed by the effect of calling the `destroy()` method.\n   @property isDestroyed\n  @default false\n  @public\n*/\n\n/**\n  Destruction scheduled flag.

It contains one method: `say()`.\n   You can also create a subclass from any existing class by calling its `extend()` method.\n  For example, you might want to create a subclass of Ember's built-in `Ember.Component` class:\n   ```javascript\n  const PersonComponent = Ember.Component.extend({\n    tagName: 'li',\n    classNameBindings: ['isAdministrator']\n  });\n  ```\n   When defining a subclass, you can override methods but still access the\n  implementation of your parent class by calling the special `_super()` method:\n   ```javascript\n  const Person = Ember.Object.extend({\n    say(thing) {\n      let name = this.get('name');\n      alert(`${name} says: ${thing}`);\n    }\n  });\n   const Soldier = Person.extend({\n    say(thing) {\n      this._super(`${thing}, sir!`);\n    },\n    march(numberOfHours) {\n      alert(`${this.get('name')} marches for ${numberOfHours} hours.`);\n    }\n  });\n   let yehuda = Soldier.create({\n    name: 'Yehuda Katz'\n  });\n   yehuda.say('Yes');  // alerts \"Yehuda Katz says: Yes, sir!\"\n  ```\n   The `create()` on line #17 creates an *instance* of the `Soldier` class.\n  The `extend()` on line #8 creates a *subclass* of `Person`. Any instance\n  of the `Person` class will *not* have the `march()` method.\n   You can also pass `Mixin` classes to add additional properties to the subclass.\n   ```javascript\n  const Person = Ember.Object.extend({\n    say(thing) {\n      alert(`${this.get('name')} says: ${thing}`);\n    }\n  });\n   const SingingMixin = Mixin.create({\n    sing(thing){\n      alert(`${this.get('name')} sings: la la la ${thing}`);\n    }\n  });\n   const BroadwayStar = Person.extend(SingingMixin, {\n    dance() {\n      alert(`${this.get('name')} dances: tap tap tap tap `);\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   The `BroadwayStar` class contains three methods: `say()`, `sing()`, and `dance()`.\n   @method extend\n  @static\n   @param {Mixin} [mixins]* One or more Mixin classes\n  @param {Object} [arguments]* Object containing values to use within the new class\n  @public\n*/\n\n/**\n  Creates an instance of a class.

The\n    primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n    registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason\n    why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n  \n    Terminology\n    -----------\n  \n    - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n    - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n    - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n    - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n    - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n    - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n  \n    A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n  \n    Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n    state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n    rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n  \n    Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n    promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n    settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n    itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n    itself fulfill.\n  \n  \n    Basic Usage:\n    ------------\n  \n    ```js\n    let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n      // on success\n      resolve(value);\n  \n      // on failure\n      reject(reason);\n    });\n  \n    promise.then(function(value) {\n      // on fulfillment\n    }, function(reason) {\n      // on rejection\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Advanced Usage:\n    ---------------\n  \n    Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n    `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n  \n    ```js\n    function getJSON(url) {\n      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n        let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  \n        xhr.open('GET', url);\n        xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n        xhr.responseType = 'json';\n        xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n        xhr.send();\n  \n        function handler() {\n          if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n            if (this.status === 200) {\n              resolve(this.response);\n            } else {\n              reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n            }\n          }\n        };\n      });\n    }\n  \n    getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n      // on fulfillment\n    }, function(reason) {\n      // on rejection\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n  \n    ```js\n    Promise.all([\n      getJSON('/posts'),\n      getJSON('/comments')\n    ]).then(function(values){\n      values[0] // => postsJSON\n      values[1] // => commentsJSON\n  \n      return values;\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @class RSVP.Promise\n    @param {function} resolver\n    @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n    Useful for tooling.\n    @constructor\n  */\n  function Promise(resolver, label) {\n    this._id = counter++;\n    this._label = label;\n    this._state = undefined;\n    this._result = undefined;\n    this._subscribers = [];\n\n    config.instrument && instrument('created', this);\n\n    if (noop !== resolver) {\n      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n    }\n  }\n\n  Promise.cast = resolve$1; // deprecated\n  Promise.all = all;\n  Promise.race = race;\n  Promise.resolve = resolve$1;\n  Promise.reject = reject$1;\n\n  Promise.prototype = {\n    constructor: Promise,\n\n    _guidKey: guidKey,\n\n    _onError: function (reason) {\n      var promise = this;\n      config.after(function () {\n        if (promise._onError) {\n          config['trigger']('error', reason, promise._label);\n        }\n      });\n    },\n\n    /**\n      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n    \n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function(user){\n        // user is available\n      }, function(reason){\n        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Chaining\n      --------\n    \n      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n      promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n      or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n    \n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return user.name;\n      }, function (reason) {\n        return 'default name';\n      }).then(function (userName) {\n        // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n        // will be `'default name'`\n      });\n    \n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n      }, function (reason) {\n        throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we\\'re unhappy');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n        // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we\\'re unhappy'.\n      });\n      ```\n      If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n    \n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Assimilation\n      ------------\n    \n      Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n      retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n      fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n      until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n    \n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // The user's comments are now available\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n    \n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Simple Example\n      --------------\n    \n      Synchronous Example\n    \n      ```javascript\n      let result;\n    \n      try {\n        result = findResult();\n        // success\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // failure\n      }\n      ```\n    \n      Errback Example\n    \n      ```js\n      findResult(function(result, err){\n        if (err) {\n          // failure\n        } else {\n          // success\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Promise Example;\n    \n      ```javascript\n      findResult().then(function(result){\n        // success\n      }, function(reason){\n        // failure\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Advanced Example\n      --------------\n    \n      Synchronous Example\n    \n      ```javascript\n      let author, books;\n    \n      try {\n        author = findAuthor();\n        books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n        // success\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // failure\n      }\n      ```\n    \n      Errback Example\n    \n      ```js\n    \n      function foundBooks(books) {\n    \n      }\n    \n      function failure(reason) {\n    \n      }\n    \n      findAuthor(function(author, err){\n        if (err) {\n          failure(err);\n          // failure\n        } else {\n          try {\n            findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n              if (err) {\n                failure(err);\n              } else {\n                try {\n                  foundBooks(books);\n                } catch(reason) {\n                  failure(reason);\n                }\n              }\n            });\n          } catch(error) {\n            failure(err);\n          }\n          // success\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Promise Example;\n    \n      ```javascript\n      findAuthor().\n        then(findBooksByAuthor).\n        then(function(books){\n          // found books\n      }).catch(function(reason){\n        // something went wrong\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      @method then\n      @param {Function} onFulfillment\n      @param {Function} onRejection\n      @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @return {Promise}\n    */\n    then: then,\n\n    /**\n      `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n      as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n    \n      ```js\n      function findAuthor(){\n        throw new Error('couldn\\'t find that author');\n      }\n    \n      // synchronous\n      try {\n        findAuthor();\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // something went wrong\n      }\n    \n      // async with promises\n      findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n        // something went wrong\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      @method catch\n      @param {Function} onRejection\n      @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @return {Promise}\n    */\n    catch: function (onRejection, label) {\n      return this.then(undefined, onRejection, label);\n    },\n\n    /**\n      `finally` will be invoked regardless of the promise's fate just as native\n      try/catch/finally behaves\n    \n      Synchronous example:\n    \n      ```js\n      findAuthor() {\n        if (Math.random() > 0.5) {\n          throw new Error();\n        }\n        return new Author();\n      }\n    \n      try {\n        return findAuthor();

You can use `denodeify` in Node.js or the\n    browser when you'd prefer to use promises over using callbacks. For example,\n    `denodeify` transforms the following:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n  \n    fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n      if (err) return handleError(err);\n      handleData(data);\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    into:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n    let readFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.readFile);\n  \n    readFile('myfile.txt').then(handleData, handleError);\n    ```\n  \n    If the node function has multiple success parameters, then `denodeify`\n    just returns the first one:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'));\n  \n    request('http://example.com').then(function(res) {\n      // ...\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    However, if you need all success parameters, setting `denodeify`'s\n    second parameter to `true` causes it to return all success parameters\n    as an array:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'), true);\n  \n    request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n      // result[0] -> res\n      // result[1] -> body\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Or if you pass it an array with names it returns the parameters as a hash:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'), ['res', 'body']);\n  \n    request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n      // result.res\n      // result.body\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Sometimes you need to retain the `this`:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let app = require('express')();\n    let render = RSVP.denodeify(app.render.bind(app));\n    ```\n  \n    The denodified function inherits from the original function. It works in all\n    environments, except IE 10 and below. Consequently all properties of the original\n    function are available to you. However, any properties you change on the\n    denodeified function won't be changed on the original function. Example:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request')),\n        cookieJar = request.jar(); // <- Inheritance is used here\n  \n    request('http://example.com', {jar: cookieJar}).then(function(res) {\n      // cookieJar.cookies holds now the cookies returned by example.com\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Using `denodeify` makes it easier to compose asynchronous operations instead\n    of using callbacks. For example, instead of:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n  \n    fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n      if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n      fs.writeFile('myfile2.txt', data, function(err){\n        if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n        console.log('done')\n      });\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    you can chain the operations together using `then` from the returned promise:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n    let readFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.readFile);\n    let writeFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.writeFile);\n  \n    readFile('myfile.txt').then(function(data){\n      return writeFile('myfile2.txt', data);\n    }).then(function(){\n      console.log('done')\n    }).catch(function(error){\n      // Handle error\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method denodeify\n    @static\n    @for RSVP\n    @param {Function} nodeFunc a 'node-style' function that takes a callback as\n    its last argument.

A controller implementing validations on those properties could look like this:\n  \n   ```js\n   import Ember from 'ember';\n   import EmberValidations from 'ember-validations';\n  \n   export default Ember.Controller.extend(EmberValidations,{\n     email: null,\n     password: null,\n     rememberMe: false,\n     validations: {\n       email: {\n         presence: true,\n         format: {\n           with: /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$/\n         }\n       },\n       password: {\n         presence: true,\n         length: { minimum: 6, maximum: 10}\n       },\n       comments: {\n         length: { minimum: 5, maximum: 20}\n       }\n     }\n   });\n   ```\n  \n   If the `showValidation` property is `true` (which is automatically the case if a `focusOut` event is captured from the\n   control element or the containing `Components.Form` was submitted with its `model` failing validation) and there are\n   validation errors for the `model`'s `property`, the appropriate Bootstrap validation markup (see\n   http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms-control-validation) is applied:\n  \n   * `validation` is set to 'error', which will set the `has-error` CSS class\n   * the `errorIcon` feedback icon is displayed if `controlType` is a text field\n   * the validation messages are displayed as Bootstrap `help-block`s in BS3 and `form-control-feedback` in BS4\n  \n   The same applies for warning messages, if the used validation library supports this. (Currently only\n   [ember-cp-validations](https://github.com/offirgolan/ember-cp-validations))\n  \n   As soon as the validation is successful again...\n  \n   * `validation` is set to 'success', which will set the `has-success` CSS class\n   * the `successIcon` feedback icon is displayed if `controlType` is a text field\n   * the validation messages are removed\n  \n   In case you want to display some error message that is independent of the model's validation, for example to display\n   a failure message on a login form after a failed authentication attempt (so not coming from the validation library),\n   you can use the `customError` property to do so.\n  \n   ### Custom controls\n  \n   Apart from the standard built-in browser controls (see the `controlType` property), you can use any custom control simply\n   by invoking the component with a block template. Use whatever control you might want, for example a select-2 component\n   (from the [ember-select-2 addon](https://istefo.github.io/ember-select-2)):\n  \n   ```hbs\n   {{#bs-form model=this onSubmit=(action \"submit\") as |form|}}\n     {{#form.element label=\"Select-2\" property=\"gender\" useIcons=false as |el|}}\n       {{select-2 id=el.id content=genderChoices optionLabelPath=\"label\" value=el.value searchEnabled=false}}\n     {{/form.element}}\n   {{/bs-form}}\n   ```\n  \n   The component yields a hash with the following properties:\n   * `control`: the component that would be used for rendering the form control based on the given `controlType`\n   * `id`: id to be used for the form control, so it matches the labels `for` attribute\n   * `value`: the value of the form element\n   * `validation`: the validation state of the element, `null` if no validation is to be shown, otherwise 'success', 'error' or 'warning'\n  \n   If your custom control does not render an input element, you should set `useIcons` to `false` since bootstrap only supports\n   feedback icons with textual `<input class=\"form-control\">` elements.\n  \n   If you just want to customize the existing control component, you can use the aforementioned yielded `control` component\n   to customize that existing component:\n  \n   ```hbs\n   {{#bs-form model=this onSubmit=(action \"submit\") as |form|}}\n     {{#form.element label=\"Email\" placeholder=\"Email\" property=\"email\" as |el|}}\n       {{el.control class=\"input-lg\"}}\n     {{/form.element}}\n   {{/bs-form}}\n   ```\n  \n   ### HTML attributes\n  \n   To set HTML attributes on the control element provided by this component, set them as properties of this component:\n  \n   ```hbs\n   {{#bs-form formLayout=\"horizontal\" model=this action=\"submit\" as |form|}}\n   {{form.element controlType=\"email\" label=\"Email\" property=\"email\"\n     placeholder=\"Email\"\n     required=true\n     multiple=true\n     tabIndex=5\n   }}\n   ...\n   {{/bs-form}}\n   ```\n  \n   The following attributes are supported depending on the `controlType`:\n  \n   <table class=\"table table-striped\">\n   <thead>\n   <tr>\n   <th></th>\n   <th>textarea</th>\n   <th>checkbox</th>\n   <th>all others</th>\n   </tr>\n   </thead>\n   <tbody>\n   <tr>\n   <td>accept</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>autocomplete</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>autofocus</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>autosave</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>cols</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td></td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>disabled</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>form</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>inputmode</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>max</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>maxlength</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>min</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>minlength</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>multiple</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>name</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>pattern</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>placeholder</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>readonly</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>required</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>rows</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td></td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>size</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>spellcheck</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>step</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>tabindex</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>title</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n   <td>wrap</td>\n   <td>✔︎</td>\n   <td></td>\n   <td></td>\n   </tr>\n   </tbody>\n   </table>\n  \n   @class FormElement\n   @namespace Components\n   @extends Components.FormGroup\n   @public\n   */\n  exports.default = _group.default.extend({\n    layout: _element.default,\n    classNameBindings: ['disabled:is-disabled', 'required:is-required', 'isValidating'],\n\n    /**\n     * Text to display within a `<label>` tag.\n     *\n     * You should include a label for every form input cause otherwise screen readers\n     * will have trouble with your forms.
